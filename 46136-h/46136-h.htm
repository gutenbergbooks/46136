<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="figleft75" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/i_011.jpg" width="75" height="98" alt="" /></span>
IT is, perhaps, a little singular that up to the present
no work making any pretension to completeness has
appeared in English dealing with that little instrument
so intimately associated with both civil and religious
life of the past, the Fan. Even on the Continent the
literature of the Fan is exceedingly scanty. M. Blondel’s
work, <i>Histoire des Éventails</i>, published in 1875, is but sparsely illustrated,
and is mainly based upon the researches of M. Natalis Rondot,
whose <i>Rapport sur les objets de Parure</i> was undertaken at the instance
of the French Government in 1854. An English translation of M. Octave
Uzanne’s brilliant sketch appeared in 1884, and is unillustrated except
by fanciful border designs; while Lady Charlotte Schreiber’s stately
tomes and Mrs. Salwey’s <i>Fans of Japan</i> deal only with more or less
isolated portions of the subject. These, together with <i>Der Fächer</i>,
by Georg Buss, appearing in 1904, one or two illustrated catalogues
and a few desultory magazine articles, form the sum-total of the Fan’s
literature. This paucity of book material, and the general absence of
information amongst individuals, is at once an advantage and a disadvantage.
I have in dealing with this subject such benefits as the
breaking of new ground gives; I have at the same time to contend with
the difficulty of collecting information from sources so scattered, and in
many instances so obscure.</p>

<p>To the works above mentioned, which indeed have been most helpful,
it is only justice to add the admirable article on ‘Les Disques crucifères,
le Flabellum, et l’Umbella,’ in <i>La Revue de l’Art Chrétien</i>, by M. Charles
de Linas; the sparkling and entertaining ‘History on Fans’ by Henri
Bouchot in <i>Art and Letters</i> for 1883; an excellent article on Chinese
Fans by H. A. Giles in <i>Fraser’s Magazine</i> for May 1879; articles in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
various publications by MM. Paul Mantz and Charles Blanc; all these
I have freely used, and gladly acknowledge my indebtedness.</p>

<p>But, since it is scarcely possible, in a subject covering such an extended
area, to avoid inaccuracies of some sort, I must endeavour to forestall any
possible criticism by saying that no pains have been spared to render the
book as free from errors as may be. As to the line illustrations, they
must be considered merely diagrammatic, and not in any sense realistic
representations of the various objects.</p>

<p>I welcome this opportunity of making what is an unusually long list
of acknowledgments of help received. Firstly, to my Publishers for their
enterprise, the admirable manner in which the book is produced, and for
their uniform courtesy. Secondly, to the many owners of fans, these
including the most exalted personages, who have so generously responded
to my invitation to lend their fragile treasures.</p>

<p>My thanks are also due to the officials of the various Museums, those
of the Print Room of the British, and the National Art Library, Victoria
and Albert Museums; to Sir C. Purdon Clarke, C.I.E., F.S.A., and his
son, Mr. Stanley Clarke of the India Museum; Dr. Peter Jessen of the
Kunstgewerbe Museum, Berlin; Professor Pazaurek, Stuttgart; Dr. Hans
W. Singer; to Sir George Birdwood, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., who has kindly read
the three chapters on ancient fans; to Professor W. M. Flinders Petrie,
D.C.L.; Mr. W. Holman Hunt, O.M., R.W.S.; Sir L. Alma-Tadema,
O.M., R.A.; the Rev. J. Foster, D.C.L.; the Clerk of the Worshipful
Company of Fanmakers; the Librarian at Welbeck; Mr. Wilson Crewdson;
Mr. W. Harding Smith; Mr. W. L. Behrens; Mr. R. Phené Spiers;
Mr. G. F. Clausen; Mr. J. Ettlinger; Mons. J. Duvelleroy; Mr. H.
Granville Fell; Mr. Frank Brangwyn, A.R.A.; Mr. Talbot Hughes; Mr.
Frank Falkner, for help in various ways; and last, though by no means
least, to Mrs. E. P. Medley, for most valuable assistance in translation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE ORIGIN AND USES OF THE FAN</h3>

<p><span class="figleft125" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/i_025.jpg" width="125" height="130" alt="" /></span>N the beginning, before the human advent,
when the earth was peopled only by the
Immortals, a bright son was born to Aurora,
whose soft and agreeable breath was as honey
in the mouth of the gods, and the beating
of whose gossamer wings imparted a delicious
coolness to the air, moderating the heat of
summer, and providing the first suggestion
of, and occasion for, the dainty little plaything we have under consideration,
somewhat waggishly described as a kind of wind instrument, not,
perhaps, so much to be played <i>upon</i> as to be played <i>with</i>, and invaluable
as assisting to follow out the wisest of the Sage’s maxims when he bids
us keep cool.</p>

<p>This delicate toy, this airy creation of gauze, ivory, and paint, frail and
fragile almost as the flowers kissed by Aurora’s son, endowed apparently
with the gift of perpetual youth, may claim a lineage older than the
Pyramids; having its origin and being in the infancy of the world, before
the birth of history, in that golden age when life was a perpetual summer,
and care was not, when all was concord and harmony, and old age, long
protracted, was dissolved in a serene slumber, and wafted to the mansions
of the gods, the regions of eternal love and enjoyment.</p>

<p>It was in these halcyon days that the human family sat in its palm
groves, which afforded not only refreshing shade, during the hours
when the sun is at its height, but also provided the precursor of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">Pg 2</a></span>
‘Servant of Zephyrus’—serving further to temper those beams which are
the source of all life, and light, and music, for are not all the learned agreed
with the late Mr. George Augustus Sala, that if a thorn was the first needle,
doubtless a palm leaf was the first fan?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Beneath this shade the weary peasant lies,</div>
<div class="line">Plucks the broad leaf, and bids the breezes rise.’<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The poets, however, who lay claim rather to inspiration than to the dry
bones of mere learning, supply us with many fanciful suggestions as to the
fan’s origin—a Spanish story (duly told on a printed fan) has it that the
first fan was a wing which Cupid tore from the back of Zephyrus for the
purpose of fanning Psyche as she lay a-sleeping on her bed of roses.</p>

<p>A quaint, though somewhat inconsequent, conceit is that of the French
eighteenth-century poet, Augustin de Piis, quoted by M. Uzanne in his
work on the fan, in which Cupid, at an inopportune moment, surprises the
Graces, who were as much embarrassed as the god was delighted—to hide
their confusion, with the hand that was unemployed, they endeavoured to
cover up both eyes by spreading the fingers.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘And soon Dan Cupid was aware</div>
<div class="line i1">That though they veiled their eyes, between</div>
<div class="line">The fingers of that Trio fair</div>
<div class="line i1">Himself was very clearly seen;</div>
<div class="line">On which his little curly head</div>
<div class="line i1">Deeply to meditate began,</div>
<div class="line">Till from their fair hands thus outspread</div>

<p>Whether we accept this explanation or not, and whatever circumstances
attended the origin of the fan, it is abundantly clear that Cupid had a hand
in it. Has not Gay told how the master Cupid traced out the lines,
conceived the shape, converted his arrows into sticks, and from their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">Pg 3</a></span>barbed points, softened by love’s flame, forged the pin? Is not the fan one
of the chief weapons in the armoury of the Love-God? Is it not the
rampart from behind which the fiercest fire of love’s artillery is directed?
Nay, is it not in very truth the sceptre of the Love-God? Did not the
Greeks early recognise this fact by placing the plumed fan in the hands
of Eros himself? The fan is at once the <i>creation</i> of Amor and the chief
ensign of his sovereignty!</p>

<p>And its uses?</p>

<p>Madame la Baronne de Chapt, in the first volume of her <i>Œuvres
Philosophiques</i>, discovers a hundred such:—‘It is so charming, so convenient,
so suited to give countenance to a young girl, and to extricate her
from embarrassment, that it cannot be too much exalted; we see it straying
over cheeks, bosoms, hands, with an elegance which everywhere provokes
admiration.</p>

<p>‘Love uses a fan as an infant does a toy—makes it assume all sorts of
shapes; breaks it even, lets it fall a thousand times to the ground....</p>

<p>‘Is it a matter of indifference, this fallen fan? Such a fall is the result
of reflection, of careful calculation, intended as a test of the ardour and
celerity of aspiring suitors.—And the successful suitor, the favoured swain?
Is it not he who discovers the greatest celerity in returning the fan to its
charming owner, and, in doing so, imprints a secret but chaste kiss upon
the fair hand that takes it, and is rewarded by a look ten thousand times
more eloquent than speech?’</p>

<p>And if, peradventure, by the spell of some magician, this little
instrument could itself be endowed with speech! Aha! ma chère madame,
what tales could it not unfold from the recesses of its fluted leaves, what
whispers! what confidences! what assignations! what <i>intrigues</i>!</p>

<p>‘Pour une Espagnole,’ writes Charles Blanc, ‘toutes les intrigues de
l’amour, tous les manœuvres de la galanterie, sont cachées dans les plis de
son éventail. Les audaces furtifs du regard, les aventures de la parole, les<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">Pg 4</a></span>
aveux risqués, les demi-mots proférés du bout des lèvres, tout cela est
dissimulé par l’éventail, qui a l’air d’interdire ce qu’il permet de faire, et
d’intercepter ce qu’il envoie.’</p>

<p>Disraeli (<i>Contarini Fleming</i>), in similar strain, with no less eloquence,
says: ‘A Spanish lady with her fan might shame the tactics of a troop of
horse. Now she unfolds it with the slow pomp and conscious elegance
of the bird of Juno; now she flutters it with all the languor of a listless
beauty, now with all the liveliness of a vivacious one. Now in the midst
of a very tornado she closes it with a whirr, which makes you start.
Magical instrument! in this land it speaks a particular language, and
gallantry requires no other mode to express its most subtle conceits, or
its most unreasonable demands, than this delicate machine.’</p>

<p>‘Women,’ says the witty <i>Spectator</i>, ‘are armed with Fans as men with
Swords—and sometimes do more execution with them.... There is an
infinite variety of motions to be made use of in the <i>flutter of a Fan</i>.
There is the angry Flutter, the modest Flutter, the timorous Flutter, the
confused Flutter, the merry Flutter, and the amorous Flutter. Not to be
tedious, there is scarce any emotion in the mind which does not produce a
suitable agitation in the Fan; insomuch that if I only see the Fan of a
disciplined Lady I know very well whether she laughs, frowns, or blushes.
I have seen a Fan so very angry, that it would have been dangerous for
the absent lover who provoked it to have come within the wind of it:
and at other times so very languishing, that I have been glad for the
Lady’s sake the lover was at a sufficient distance from it. I need not add
that a Fan is either a Prude or Coquette according to the nature of the
person who bears it.’</p>

<p>Mr. George Meredith, too, would appear to have studied its motions:
‘Lady Denewdney’s fan took to beating time meditatively. Two or three
times she kept it elevated, and in vain: the flow of their interchanging
speech was uninterrupted. At last my father bowed to her from a distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">Pg 5</a></span>
<i>She signalled</i>: his eyelids pleaded short sight, awakening to the apprehension
of a pleasant fact; <i>the fan tapped</i>, and he halted his march, leaning
scarce perceptibly in her direction. <i>The fan showed distress.</i>’<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>In one of the sprightliest of Steele’s letters to the <i>Tatler</i>, the beauteous
Delamira, upon the eve of her marriage, resigns her fan, having no further
occasion for it. She is entreated by the matchless Virgulta, who had begun
to despair of ever entering the matrimonial state, to confide to her the
secret of her success. ‘That swimming air of your body,’ says she; ‘that
jaunty bearing of your Head over your shoulder; and that inexpressible
Beauty in your manner of playing your Fan, must be lower’d into a more
confined Behaviour; to show, That you would rather shun than receive
Addresses for the future. Therefore, dear Delamira, give me these
excellencies you leave off, and acquaint me with your Manner of
Charming.’...</p>

<p>Delamira explained that all she had above the rest of her Sex and
contemporary Beauties was wholly owing to a Fan (left to her by her
Mother, and had been long in the Family), which, whoever had in
Possession, and used with Skill, should command the hearts of all her
Beholders; ‘and since,’ said she, smiling, ‘I have no more to do with
extending my Conquests or Triumphs, I’ll make you a present of this
inestimable Rarity.’ ‘You see, Madam,’ continued she, upon Virgulta’s inquiry
as to the Management of that utensil, ‘<i>Cupid</i> is the principal Figure
painted on it; and the skill in playing this Fan is, in your several Motions
of it to let him appear as little as possible: for honourable Lovers fly all
Endeavours to ensnare ’em; and your <i>Cupid</i> must hide his Bow and
Arrow, or he’ll never be sure of his Game. You may observe that in all
publick Assemblies, the sexes seem to separate themselves, and draw up to
attack each other with Eye-shot; That is the time when the Fan, which
is all the Armour of Woman, is of most use in her Defence; for our</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">Pg 6</a></span></p>
<p>minds are constructed by the waving of that little Instrument, and our
thoughts appear in Composure or Agitation according to the Motion of it.
You may observe when Will Peregrine comes into the side Box, Miss
Gatty flutters her Fan as a Fly does its Wings round a Candle; while
her elder Sister, who is as much in Love with him as she is, is as grave
as a Vestal at his Entrance, and the consequence is accordingly. He
watches half the Play for a Glance from her Sister, while Gatty is overlooked
and neglected. I wish you heartily as much Success in the Management
of it as I have had;.... Take it, good Girl, and use it without Mercy;
for the Reign of Beauty never lasted full Three Years, but it ended
in Marriage, or Condemnation to Virginity.’<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>If the fan is efficacious as a weapon of offence in Love’s sieges, it is
no less effective as a shield against Love’s darts. On a painted Spanish
fan in the Schreiber Collection in the British Museum are represented
three fair nymphs in a wooded landscape, one of whom is receiving on
her fan an arrow discharged by the Love-God, who is accompanied by
my lady Venus in her car. On a scroll is the inscription, ‘l’utilité des
éventails,’ ‘la utilidad de los abanicos.’</p>

<p>This use of the fan as shield, is adopted also by the <i>shinláung</i>, or
monastic novitiate of Burma, who employs his large palm-fan, both
as a shelter from the fierceness of the sun’s rays, and as a screen from
the sight of womankind, moving, in the latter instance, his fan from right
to left as occasion requires, <i>i.e.</i> whenever a woman happens to pass.</p>

<p>A story, the source of which is not given,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> is told of Goldoni, who,
being one evening the guest of a Venetian lady, was complimented by
her upon the productions of his genius.</p>

<p>‘Why, my lady,’ he replied, ‘<i>anything</i> provides a subject for a comedy.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">Pg 7</a></span></p>
<p>‘Anything?’ replied the lady.</p>

<p>‘Anything,’ emphatically replied the dramatist.</p>

<p>‘Even this fan?’ insisted the Beauty.</p>

<p>‘I shall be indebted to you for life,’ exclaimed Goldoni, struck with
a happy thought. ‘You have suggested to me my best comedy; in a
week you will read it.’<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>Many and manifold are the uses of the fan. What device, for example,
could better display the beauty of a rounded arm, or the ivory whiteness of
tapered fingers? Such an instrument provides graceful and often much-needed
employment to those same delicate fingers; it supplies that
necessary sense of completeness to the <i>tout ensemble</i> of the picture.
And the comedy actress, desiring some trifle to emphasise a movement,
to give point and expression to some particular action—what more effective
instrument than a fan, the use of which, on the stage, has almost been
elevated into a fine art!</p>

<p>This at once recalls the saying of Northcote, who, although reluctantly
compelled to admit Queen Charlotte’s excessive plainness, an elegant and
not a vulgar plainness—she had a beautifully shaped arm, and was fond of
exhibiting it—exclaimed, ‘She had a fan in her hand. Lord! how she

<p>Madame D’Arblay, in one of her most delightful letters, records a

upon the occasion of a visit to her, ‘finding she entered into nothing,’
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">Pg 8</a></span>took up a fan which lay on the table and began playing off various
imitative airs with it, exclaiming, ‘How thoroughly useless a toy!’</p>

<p>‘“No,” I said, “on the contrary, taken as an ornament, it was the most
useful of any belonging to full dress; occupying the hands, giving the eyes
something to look at, and taking away stiffness and formality from the
figure and deportment.”</p>

<p>‘“Men have no fans,” cried he, “and how do they do?”</p>

<p>‘“Worse,” quoth I plumply.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">..........</span></p>

<p>‘“But the real use of the fan,” cried he, “if there is any, is it not—to
hide a particular blush that ought not to appear?”</p>

<p>‘“Oh no, it would rather make it the sooner noticed.”</p>

<p>‘“Not at all; it may be done under pretence of absence—rubbing the
cheek, or nose—putting it up accidentally to the eye—in a thousand
ways.”’</p>

<p>The uses of the Fan? They are legion!—They record for us public
events, military, political, civil; they tell us our fortunes; instruct us in
Botany, in Heraldry, in tricks with cards; they propound conundrums;
take us to the theatre, to bull-fights, to church, to the first balloon ascent;
and to Mr. Thomas Osborne’s Duck-hunting!</p>

<p>In Shakespeare’s day no lady thought of stirring abroad without this
accompaniment, the care of the toy devolving upon the gentleman usher—</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>FANS OF THE ANCIENTS</h3>

<h4>EGYPT</h4>

<p><span class="figleft200" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_040.jpg" width="200" height="129" alt="" /></span>
The word fan, or van, is derived
from the Latin <i>vannus</i>, the Roman
instrument for winnowing grain.
This winnowing-fan, held sacred
by all the peoples of the ancient
world, together with the fire-fan
(bellows), also a sacred instrument,
and used by the priestesses of Isis to fan the flame of their altars—these
must be accounted amongst the earliest of the ancient and prolific
fan-family. To the first named are several references in Holy Writ.
Isaiah, xxx. 24, speaks of the oxen and young asses that shall eat clean
provender which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.
Jeremiah, xv. 6-7, lamenting the backsliding of Jerusalem, exclaims, ‘I
am weary with repenting; and I will fan them with a fan in the
gates of the land’; and again in li. 2, ‘Send unto Babylon fanners
that shall fan her, and shall empty her land.’</p>

<p>In Matt. iii. 12, and Luke iii. 17, John the Baptist, announcing
the coming of ‘one mightier than I’—‘He shall baptize you with the
Holy Ghost and with fire: whose fan is in his hand, and he will
throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner.’</p>

<p>Both these instruments appear on a bas-relief from a tomb at
Sakkarah, of the twelfth Pharaonic dynasty, <i>circa</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2366-2266, sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">Pg 11</a></span>
hundred years before Isaiah wrote. In this some shepherds are roasting
trussed and spitted ducks over fires which are being kept alive by the
plaited, wedge-shaped hand-fan; the winnowing-fan appearing in the
same picture.</p>

<p>Servius, in commenting on Virgil’s mystical fan of Bacchus,
(‘mystica vannus Iacchi,’ <i>Georg.</i> i. 166) affirms that the sacred rites
of Bacchus pertained to the purification of souls; in Assyria, also, it
was introduced in the ceremonies connected with the worship of Bacchus
and became a sacred emblem.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> This instrument, carried at the Dionysia
or festivals in honour of Bacchus, was called Lichnon (Λίχνον), and
was so essential to the solemnities of this god, that they could not be
duly celebrated without it. So also Osiris, when judge of Amenti, holds
in his crossed hands the crook and flagellum, the mystical <i>vannus</i>—‘whose
fan is in his hand,’<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> each of these instances having reference to
the generative principle, and the improvement of the world by tillage.</p>

<p>The passage in Jeremiah xiii. 24, ‘Therefore will I scatter them as the
stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness,’ suggested the
proud motto of the Kentish family of Septvans (Setvans):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Dissipabo inimicos Regis mei ut paleam.’</div>
<div class="line i04">‘The enemies of my king will I disperse like chaff.’<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the brass of Sir Robert de Septvans, 1306, Chartham, Kent, the
knight’s shield and aillettes upon the shoulders are charged with the
winnowing-fans from which he takes his name, and small fans are
embroidered upon his surcoat. In the Lansdowne MSS. 855 B.M., the
arms are thus given: ‘Sir robt de sevens dazur e iij vans dor.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">Pg 12</a></span></p>

<p>The Greeks named ῥιπίς the large flat instrument which was used
to fan the fire: the diminutive ῥιπίδιον was applied to objects of similar
form in ordinary use amongst both sexes for the purpose of fanning as
well as to drive away the flies. Indeed the use of the fan as bellows
<span class="figleft150" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_042a.jpg" width="150" height="116" alt="" /></span>
appears to have been practically universal, and
to have dated from a very early period of the
world’s history.</p>

<p>The employment of these instruments, as
well as the forms which they assumed, is continued
even to the present day:<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> in the Republic
of Colombia, where fans are employed as much by men as by women,
the kitchen of every hut and house throughout the country is provided
with a fan in lieu of bellows, rectangular in form, albeit broader at the
outside than at the short handle, and about 12 inches by 9 inches in
size: These are formed of the young inside leaf of the cabbage-palm, the
handle and back being the rib of the leaf, the fan portion being the
fronds of the leaf plaited.</p>

<p><span class="figright125" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/i_042b.jpg" width="125" height="197" alt="" /></span>
The Portuguese fire-fans (Abano) made in
the south of Portugal, and in universal use
in that country, are round in shape, coarsely
plaited in straw or rush, and fixed in a rough
wooden handle.</p>

<p>These, representing the two simplest elemental
forms, are the primeval fans which have come
down to us from the remotest periods of history,
have endured through the centuries, and, like the
fans in use in India at present, identical as a
matter of fact with these in form, are as modern as they are ancient.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">Pg 13</a></span></p>
<p>These two fans, the winnowing-fan and the fire-fan, minister to the
two most pressing of man’s necessities—to the first of his physical
necessities, his daily bread, and to his chief mental necessity, the
attainment of the bread of life; the fire-fan keeping alive the flame
sacred to the great goddess who is the mother of all things, mistress
of the elements, giver of the golden grain, which, when ripened, is
separated from the chaff by the winnowing-fan; the one instrument,
therefore, being the complement and counterpart of the other.</p>

<p><span class="figright125" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/i_043a.jpg" width="125" height="197" alt="" /></span>
The Egyptian plaited hand-fan, used for
fanning the fire, as well as for other domestic
purposes, was made in a precisely similar way to
the Portuguese ‘Abano’ above referred to, except
that instead of being a complete circle, it assumed
the form of a rather full crescent. In the painted
decoration of a tomb at Eileithyia, representing the
interior of a storeroom, a workman is cooling, by
means of one of these hand-fans, the liquid which
is contained in a number of vases or amphoræ.</p>

<p><span class="figleft100" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/i_043b.jpg" width="100" height="140" alt="" /></span>
In a great funeral procession of a royal scribe at
Thebes, servants carry, among other offerings, similar
crescent-shaped matted fans, together with, in three
instances, the more ornamental semicircular feather
hand-fan used by ladies for the purpose of fanning
themselves, and also, with a somewhat longer handle,
waved by servitors in attendance upon great personages
of both sexes.</p>

<p>On an Egyptian tablet or stele of the twelfth dynasty, in the British
Museum, the lady Khu is seated with her husbands, receiving offerings
from their children; a hand-fan of semicircular form rests against the
seat; this evidently not of feathers, but rigid, since the construction is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">Pg 14</a></span>
suggested in the representation, and obviously used by the lady herself
rather than by attendants.</p>

<p><span class="figleft125" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/i_044a.jpg" width="125" height="170" alt="" /></span>The handles of these fans were of ivory,
of wood painted, or of sandalwood, which latter,
when warmed by the fingers, exhaled a delicious
perfume.</p>

<p>A few fan-handles exist in the various public
museums; two occur in the British Museum,
together with a portion of a handle inscribed with
the name of Nebseni, inspector of the goldsmiths
of Amen, eighteenth dynasty, illustrated opposite.</p>

<p>A primitive fly-whisk, of the type seen on the Assyrian monuments,
appears in the Louvre, under Egypt, but undated and undescribed;
<span class="figright50" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/i_044b.jpg" width="50" height="167" alt="" /></span>
it is formed of grassy reeds of a buff ochre colour, bent
backwards at the handle, and rudely tied with the same
substance, the length being about 2 feet 6 inches.</p>

<p>The standard, banner, and processional fans are usually
formed of the feathers of the larger birds, fixed in a long
wooden handle, the feathers, as well as the handle, being
painted or dyed in brilliant colours. These, as will be seen
by a reference to the examples from Rosellini, are designed
with the consummate sense of proportion distinguishing
all Egyptian work. In both the examples given, the tips
of the feathers are surmounted by a tuft of small fluffy
feathers, this being a device common to many countries, and is seen
in the North American Indian fan illustrated, page 82.</p>

<p>Many of these standard and processional fans, doubtless, were formed
of some material stretched upon a semicircular frame, the fan decorated in
various ways. They were in attendance on the king wherever he went;
they were also used as standards in war, the king’s chariot being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">Pg 15</a></span>always accompanied by at least two. The fact that they were dedicated to
the service of the gods is evidenced by a stele in the museum at Boulak,
on which is represented Osiris enthroned with a flabellifer behind,
waving the long-handled fan. The radiate fans, writes Professor Flinders
Petrie, were used as sunshades, appearing in hieroglyphs as the
determination of <i>Khaib</i>, <i>i.e.</i> shadow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">Pg 16</a></span></p>

<p>Numerous representations of these long-handled, semicircular,
standard fans occur on the monuments. At Thebes (Rhamessium) is

figured a reception of the military chiefs and
foreign envoys by Rameses <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> Two servitors
behind the king carry these fans, and two fan-bearers
wave the ostrich-feather emblem.</p>

<p>At Medinet Abu, the same king is seated in
his chariot with three servitors waving the long-handled,
semicircular fans.</p>

<p>The tall, single ostrich plume was probably in
the first instance a fly-whisk. It was the principal
ensign of the office of fan-bearer, which was one
of great distinction, and one of the highest in the
gift of the monarch, none but royal princes or
scions of the first nobility being permitted to hold
it. The ceremony of investiture took place in the
presence of the king seated upon his throne, and
was usually performed after a victory, and granted
for some distinguished service in the field. Two
priests invest the holder with the robe, chain, and
other insignia of his office, the fortunate recipient
of the honour raising aloft the flabellum and
crook, thus expressing his fidelity to his king and master. This was
the usual formula of investiture of high office; its resemblance to the
biblical account of Joseph’s advancement will at once be apparent.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph’s
hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his
neck.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon the field of battle the fan-bearers either attended the monarch
on foot or took command of a division with the rank of general. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">Pg 17</a></span>
the heat of battle, whether mounted in cars or engaged on foot, they
either carried the emblem of their office in their hand, or slung it behind
them. Their privileges were many, amongst them being the right of
presenting prisoners to the king after a victory. The office was divided
into two grades—those who served upon the right and left of the
king respectively, the most honourable post being always conferred upon
<span class="figright200" style="width: 200px;">

<span class="center f07">INVESTITURE OF THE OFFICE OF FAN-BEARER<br />
(From Wilkinson.)</span></span>
those of the highest rank, or for
the most distinguished services.
A certain number were always on
duty, and were required to carry
the monarch in the palanquin or
chair of state, and to attend
during the grand solemnities of
the temple and upon all occasions
of high state ceremonial.</p>

<p>The monuments bear eloquent
testimony to the importance
and significance of this object.
At Thebes (palace of Medinet
Abu), Rameses Méiamoun appears
in a magnificent palanquin, surrounded
by no less than twenty
bearers of the fan emblem, amongst
whom are the sons of the king.</p>

<p>In the same palace the ten sons of Rameses appear in the order of
their precedence, bearing the emblem; the hieroglyphics, by their side,
indicating their name and functions.</p>

<p>On an occasion when the king (Rameses <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>) receives the homage of
the chiefs of the army, two servitors with the long semicircular fans, and
two bearers of the fan emblem, are in attendance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">Pg 18</a></span></p>

<p>The highest significance of the fan emblem is when it is grasped by
the talons of the sacred vulture, guardian and protectress of the monarchs.
This figure occurs repeatedly on the monuments; at Medinet Abu,
Rameses-Méiamoun is seen subduing an army of Asiatics, the vulture
waving the fan emblem over the head of the king.</p>

<p>In the temple of Beit Oually in Nubia, Rameses <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>., helmeted, is
striding over a fallen barbarian; the vulture of protection hovers around the
head of the hero. On the same monument Rameses seizes by the hair a
barbarian with broken bow, the vulture again in attendance. Upon the
completion of the victory, four fan-bearers, each with crook and flabellum,
offer the spoils of conquest to the king.</p>

<p>On a bas-relief at Thebes, Seti <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> is seen in his war-chariot subduing
the barbarians, also accompanied by the vulture.</p>

<p>At Philæ, Ptolemy Philometor appears with a group of vanquished
Asiatics, the vulture once more in attendance.</p>

<p>In the papyrus of Hunefer (Book of the Dead) a winged Utchat, with
Eye of Horus, waves the fan emblem over the head of Osiris.</p>

<p>In the papyrus of Anhai, over the Standard of the West, which
crowns the Solar Mount and supports the hawk Rā-Harmachis, two
winged Hori appear as the protecting principle.</p>

<p>This symbol of the vulture forms a motif for surface decoration
on the ceiling of the hypostyle hall of the Rhamessium. Above the great
bell capital, the vulture, grasping in each talon a fan emblem, is treated
as a repeated ornamental pattern; it also appears as decoration of the
umbrella or canopy of the chariot of Rameses <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> (Sesostris).</p>

<p>We are thus enabled to realise the great part played by the fan
alike in the military, civil, and religious life of Egypt. As an instrument
in the hands of private persons, or even of slaves in attendance on
individuals, it is less in evidence on the monuments, although we may
naturally assume that in a climate such as Egypt this instrument would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">Pg 19</a></span>
be in constant requisition. We strain the eye of imagination to the very
earliest period of the history of this mystic land, and see in fancy the
Queen of Menes the Thinite, surrounded by slaves only a little less fair
than herself, waving the fan of square form actually appearing on a
cylinder in the Louvre; we see, also in fancy, the famed and beautiful
Queen Nitôcris, the handsomest woman of her time, builder of the third
Pyramid, reclining upon her couch, the air being rendered less oppressive
by the waving of the soft feather fan with which the monuments have
made us familiar. Lastly, have we not Shakespeare’s glowing picture of
the fanning of the voluptuous ‘serpent of old Nile,’ Cleopatra?</p>

<h3>FANS OF THE ANCIENTS—<i>Continued</i></h3>

<h4>ASSYRIA</h4>

<p><span class="figleft75" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/i_052.jpg" width="75" height="225" alt="" /></span>
The employment of the fan in the religious ceremonies
of Assyria has already been hinted at. There can be
no possibility of doubt that the ceremonies and customs,
both sacred and secular, connected with the fan, were
common to all the countries of the East, these being
the offspring of similar conditions and necessities.
Thus we have in Assyrian sculpture frequent representations
of the fly-whisk. On a bas-relief from Nimroud
King Sennacherib is standing in his chariot superintending
the moving of a colossal figure at the building of his
palace at Kouyunjik, two attendants behind the chariot
bearing an umbrella and fly-whisk; on another relief we
see Assur-bani-pal standing, bow and arrow in hand,
pouring out a libation over four dead lions before an altar, his umbrella-bearer
and fly-flapper being in attendance. We are also introduced to the
garden or palm-grove of Assur-bani-pal’s palace, wherein the king is being
entertained by his queen at a banquet; the queen holding in her left hand
what is evidently a small fan and of the shape and general appearance of the
pleated fan, but probably rigid.</p>

<p>The royal fan-bearers were two in number, invariably eunuchs, their
usual place being behind the monarch. The long-tasselled scarf appears to
be the badge of the office, which was one of great dignity. Its holder was
privileged to leave his station behind the throne and hand his master the
sacred cup, the royal scent-bottle, or handkerchief, which latter article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">Pg 21</a></span>
invariably appears in the left hand. The usage of this office seems to have
been very similar to that of Egypt; in the absence of the vizier, or in
<span class="figright125" style="width: 125px;">

subordination to him, he introduced captives to

<p>The matter of the ‘handkerchief’ opens up
an important question. Sir George Birdwood, in
a masterly address before the Society of Arts on
the subject of ancient fans, says: ‘On a “marble”
in the British Museum, from Kouyunjik (near
Mossul, <i>i.e.</i> Nineveh), representing Sennacherib,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 681-705, enthroned before Lachish, two attendants
stand behind the throne, each waving in
his right hand, over the monarch’s head, a <i>murchal</i>
(fly-whisk) of undoubted peacocks’ feathers, and
each bearing in his left hand what I identify
<span class="figleft150" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_053b.jpg" width="150" height="224" alt="" /></span>
as the <i>cover of the murchal</i>. It is absurd to
take it to be a pocket-handkerchief.’</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mr. S. W. Bushell,
in his <i>Handbook of Chinese Art</i>, refers to the
<i>fan- and towel-bearers</i> in the Chinese sculptures
of the Han dynasty; these, although somewhat
differing in shape from those of the Assyrian
reliefs, evidently served a similar purpose.</p>

<p>It is an extremely difficult point to determine;
in the reliefs of Assur-bani-pal at
Susiana, of Sennacherib at Kouyunjik, and
others, two flabelliferæ walk behind the king’s
chariot bearing in their right hands the fly-whisks, their left hands not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">Pg 22</a></span>being seen. Standing in the umbrella-covered chariot, immediately
behind the king and charioteer, a figure bears a smaller handkerchief or
cover in his <i>right</i> hand, but no evidence of a fly-whisk. The left hand
in this instance also does not appear in the relief. In a representation
of Assur-bani-pal in the Louvre (Layard, <i>Monuments</i>, Series <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> Plate 51),
the king holds in his right hand a small fan; an attendant behind holds
the cover or handkerchief in his right hand, but no fly-whisk. These
objects are in most instances fringed, and in some cases embroidered
with a narrow border.</p>

<p>Assyrian fly-whisks were usually of feathers, set in a short handle of
ivory, wood, or other material, carved or otherwise ornamented. There were
two kinds, a smaller one which was a kind of brush, made of horse-hair or
vegetable fibre, and a larger one of feathers; the short brush fan belongs to
the earlier period, the long feathered form to the later.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>The two forms, however, appear at the same time. In the bas-relief of
the banquet above referred to, attendants bear dishes of fruits and meats,
each being provided with the small fly-whisk, evidently for the purpose of
driving away insects from the royal dishes.</p>

<p>The ceremonies and usages connected with the fly-whisk open up a
vast field of inquiry, far too involved to be adequately dealt with here; some
few aspects may, however, be touched upon.</p>

<p>Baal-zebub, Beel-zebub, Beel-zebut, Bel-zebub, the Philistine god of
Ekron, whom the Jews represented as Prince of Devils, was literally Lord
Fly, or Lord of the Flies. When Ahaziah was sick he sent to consult the
Lord Fly’s oracle.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>The word Baal simply means owner, master, or lord. In Phœnicia and
Carthage it was the custom of kings and great men to unite their names with
that of their god, as Hannibal, ‘grace of Baal,’ Hasdrubal, ‘help of Baal.’
Amongst the Jews also many names of cities were compounded with Baal;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">Pg 23</a></span>as Baal-Gad, Baal-Hammon, Baal-Thamar. In the ‘authorised version’ the
name is Baal-zebub, afterwards changed to Beel-zebub; the original conception
is, however, one of great difficulty and obscurity, unless, indeed, we
may directly connect the worship of Baal with that of the sun. Josephus
declares that the Assyrians erected the first statue of Mars, and worshipped
him as a God, calling him Baal. We read in the book of Kings how
Josiah destroyed the altars which had been reared by Manasseh, and ‘put
down the idolatrous priests, ... them also that burned incense unto Baal,
to the sun and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of
heaven’; these instances suggesting that Baal and the sun were two separate
deities. On the other hand, Baal-Hammon is represented on a Carthaginian
monument with a crown of rays. Baalbek was called by the Greeks
Heliopolis (sun-city) and at Baal-Shemeh (house of the sun) there was a
temple to Baal.</p>

<p>If, therefore, we may regard Baal and the sun as synonymous, the
matter is at once simplified, since the sun is the bringer of flies, and is in
actual fact Lord of the Flies.</p>

<p>According to Pliny, the Cyrenians offered sacrifices to the fly-catching
god Achor, because the flies bred pestilence, and this author remarks that no
sooner is the sacrifice offered, than the flies perish.</p>

<p>The Greeks had their Jupiter Myiodes, or fly-hunter, to whom a bull
was sacrificed in order to propitiate him in driving away the flies which
infested the Olympic Games. There was also a Hercules Myiodes, the
origin of whose worship Pausanias declares to have been the following:—Hercules,
being molested by swarms of flies while he was about to offer
sacrifice to Olympian Jupiter in the temple, offered a victim to that god
under the name of Myagron, upon which all the flies flew away beyond the
river Alpheus. Pausanias further refers to the festival of Athena at
Aliphera in Arcadia, which was opened with a sacrifice and prayer to the Fly-catcher,
and states that after the sacrifice, the flies gave no further trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">Pg 24</a></span></p>

<p>Ælian (<i>Nat. An.</i>, xi. 8) affirms that at the festival of Apollo in the
island of Leucas, an ox was sacrificed; the flies, glutted with the blood, gave
no further trouble. The same author states that the flies of Pisa (Olympia)
were more virtuous, because they did their duty, not for a consideration, but
out of pure regard for the god.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>Scaliger derives the name of Beel-zebub, the false god, from Baalim-Zebabim,
which signifies <i>lord of sacrifices</i>. This deity was worshipped
during the time of our Saviour, who is accused by the Pharisees of casting
out devils by Beel-zebub, the prince of the devils. So Holman Hunt, in his
picture of the finding of the Saviour in the Temple, with fine perception,
places a fly-whisk in the hand of a child.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> A child is here propounding to
his elders a purer and loftier system of ethics than had heretofore been
dreamed of; a child, likewise, banishes the servants of Belial.</p>

<p>With the Jewish writers of the Middle Ages the worship of Baal
frequently signified the practising of the rites of the Christian religion;
thus Rabbi Joseph Ben Meir in his <i>Chronicles</i> states that Clovis forsook
his God and worshipped Baal, and that a high place was built at Paris for
Baal Dionysius, <i>i.e.</i> the Cathedral of St. Denis.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>The Assyrians employed the tall standard and sceptral fans in a
precisely similar way to the Egyptians. In the restoration of the palace
of Sargon (Khorsabad), compiled by Felix Thomas, given by Perrot and
Chipiez, <i>History of Art in Chaldæa and Assyria</i>, vol. ii. p. 24, two
enormous frond standards are placed at the entrance to the Harem
Court, these being circular, formed of palm fronds in bronze gilt. ‘In
India, as in Japan,’ to quote again Sir George Birdwood, ‘the standard
is often blazoned with some totemistic, symbolical, or heraldic device, and
it was probably so blazoned in Assyria, for from Assyria the practice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">Pg 25</a></span>spread to Greece and Rome of using such devices on both standards
and shields. Later this ritual was revived by the Saracens, and was
spread over mediæval Europe by the Crusaders returning from the
Holy Land.’</p>

<p>The Assyrian disc-standards were probably of brass or other metal,
fixed to the inside of the chariot. Two devices appear on the monuments—the
Divine Archer standing on a bull, and two bulls running in
opposite directions. These were enclosed in a circle at the end of a long
staff ornamented with streamers and tassels.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>The Assyrians employed the primitive plaited fan, used in Egypt,
both crescent-shaped, square, and triangular. On a relief from Nimroud,
in the British Museum, in a circular arrangement divided into four
compartments, representing the interior of a castle with towers and
battlements, a eunuch is waving in his right hand, over a stand on which
are vases and bowls, a square, flag-shaped fan, certainly of the plaited
variety; in the left hand is what appears to be a fly-whisk.</p>

<p>On a silver dish in the Strogonoff collection illustrated in <i>Orientalische
Teppiche, Alois Riegl</i>, a Sassanian monarch is seated, cross-legged, holding
a tazza, and attended by two servitors, one of whom waves a plaited flag-fan
of oblong shape. The dish, which bears strong traces of Indian
influence, is probably of the period of Varannes <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 273-277.</p>

<p>The swinging-fan, suspended from the ceiling, and operated by
pulling a cord, is an ancient device for cooling the air of rooms. The
testimony of an Assyrian bas-relief from Nineveh indicates its use at the
period to which these sculptures belong—seventh to tenth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
Wicquefort, in his translation of the embassy of Garcias de Figueron,
gives the name of fan to a kind of chimney or ventiduct, in use among
the Persians, to furnish air and wind into their houses, without which
the heat would be insupportable.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">Pg 26</a></span></p>

<p>A variant of this device for ventilating rooms is recorded in Chinese
annals. Under the Han dynasty, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 205-<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 25, a skilful workman
at Ch’ang—and named Ting Huan—made a fan of seven large wheels
10 feet in diameter, the whole turned by a single man.</p>

<p>The luxurious Guez de Balzac, in the twentieth letter, written from
Rome in 1621, to the Cardinal de la Villette, with his customary extravagant
hyperbole, describes his method of guarding against the heat during
the broiling month of July—‘Four servants constantly fan my apartments;
<i>they raise wind enough to make a tempestuous sea</i>.’</p>

<h3>FANS OF THE ANCIENTS—<i>Continued</i></h3>

<h4>GREECE AND ROME</h4>

<p><span class="figleft150" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_061.jpg" width="150" height="188" alt="" /></span>
In Greece, as in Egypt, the fan had a sacred
as well as a secular use. M. Uzanne refers
to the fan of feathers which those discreet
and irreproachable ladies, the Vestals, made
use of to fan the flame of their sacrifices,
and, rather roguishly, seizes the idea of fanning
the flame to suggest that of <i>inward
flames</i> kindled by the arrows of the little
god Cupid, in place of the chaste ardours of
the sacred mysteries. The fans of the priests
of Isis, when Isis was a Grecian divinity, were formed of the wings of
a bird, attached to the end of a long wand, and thus made to resemble
the caduceus of Mercury.</p>

<p>The Greeks received the fan from Egypt and Assyria through the
Phœnicians, who were the traders between the east and the west. In the
sarcophagus of Amanthus (Cyprio-Phœnician), representing a train of
horsemen, footmen, and chariots, the horses’ heads are adorned with a
pleated fan crest, similar to that which was used by the Persians; the
figure in the first <i>biga</i> carries a parasol. Thus Perrot and Chipiez in
their description of this monument: ‘The parasol which shades the head
of the great person in the first <i>biga</i> is the symbol of Asiatic royalty: the
fan-shaped plume which rises above the heads of all the chariot horses,
is an ornament that one sees in the same position in Assyria and Lycia,
when the sculptor desires to represent horses magnificently caparisoned.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">Pg 28</a></span></p>

<p>This remarkable example is of the highest interest as showing that
the pleated form—in this instance, doubtless, rigid, and fixed to a short
handle, also seen in both Egyptian and Assyrian monuments—has been
employed from a very remote period.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>The earliest Greek fans were, doubtless, branches of the myrtle,
acacia, the triple leaves of the Oriental plantain, and also the leaves of the
lotus, which latter, together with the myrtle, were consecrated to Venus,
were symbols of the <i>dolce far niente</i>, and therefore peculiarly appropriate
to this instrument of reposeful ease. The myrtle bough was also used
by the Romans, as we learn from Martial, iii. 82, serving at the same
time as fan and fly-flap—</p>

<p>The single leaf or heart-shaped fan occurs constantly in Greek terra-cottas;
a number of examples are to be seen in the British and other
Museums. In the Victoria and Albert Museum is a charming little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">Pg 29</a></span>winged Amor, draped, tripping gaily along, hiding his face behind a fan
of this shape. Blondel refers to a female figure in the Louvre, seated at
a feast, holding a leaf-fan; also in a fresco at Pompeii a figure is seen
holding a fan which this author mistakes for that of a different shape, but
which is really a perspective view of the plantain-leaf. We see the
triform leaf-fan in the hands of a Tanagra figure in the collection
of Louis Fould, illustrated in the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i> for 1860;
this, as well as a number of Tanagra figures, evidently representing
priestesses of Venus. It is impossible to determine with any degree of
accuracy the material and construction of these fans: in some instances
they are evidently stretched on a frame, and adorned with ornament either
painted or embroidered; occasionally, also, the decorative motif is that
of the natural veining of the leaf; the handles being usually very short,
in many cases scarcely visible. The slight vestiges of colour remaining
on these statuettes must in no instance be taken as suggesting the
colouring of the original fans. The business of the Tanagra sculptor was
to make a <i>statuette</i> and not a portrait of any particular fan; the colouring
of the fan of the statuette would therefore be determined by the general
colour scheme of which it formed a part.</p>

<p>The circular fan of peacocks’ feathers appears as early as the fifth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and even at this date had already been used in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>References to the feather-fan are of constant occurrence in the writings
of Greek authors. A slave in the <i>Orestes</i> of Euripides exclaims: ‘After the
Phrygian fashion I chanced with the close circle of feathers to be fanning the
gale, that sported in the ringlets of Helen.’</p>

<p>Instances of the feather-fan are common on Greek vases,—on the
Campanian Hydra (F. 212), British Museum, the shape in this instance
being that of the reversed heart. In the fourth vase room, on an oil-flask,
with Aphrodite seated in the lap of Adonis, a figure appears holding a very
large fan, but similar in shape to the first mentioned; and on the Apulian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">Pg 30</a></span>
Hydra, F. 352, a fan appears which is evidently a conventional representation
of the peacock feather-fan. The long-handled fan was also adopted
by the Greeks, these being waved by servants or attendants, as in Egypt.</p>

<p>The Etruscans, amongst whom the luxury of the fan is early seen, and
who transmitted it later to the Romans, used the peacock feathers, of
<span class="figleft200" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_066.jpg" width="200" height="227" alt="" />
<span class="center f07">FROM AN APULIAN HYDRA.<br />(British Museum.)</span></span>
different lengths, in a semicircle:
such a fan appears on a large
vase in the Louvre.</p>

<p>On an Etruscan crater, representing
Heracles strangling the
serpents, surrounded by the greater
gods, a fan of plain feathers is held
in the hand of one of the attendants.
On a sarcophagus at Vulci,
found in the winter of 1845-6, a
female figure appears waving a
large fan, ῥιπίς, identical in shape
with fans used in India at the
present day. In the Grotta del
Sole e della Luna (tomb of the
Sun and Moon) at Vulci, discovered in 1830, one of the ceilings has a
singular fan-pattern, given in <i>Mon. Ined. Inst.</i>, i. tav. xli., the counterpart
of which is found in two tombs at Cervetri, whence we may conclude it
was no uncommon decoration in Etruscan houses.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>In the Museo Gregorio, Rome, are half-a-dozen handles of fans, with
holes for threads or wire, to tie in feathers or leaves.</p>

<p>‘The fashion of the fan,’ says M. de Linas,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> ‘was probably introduced
into Italy in the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> We learn from Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
that Aristodemus, tyrant of Cumæ, and ally of Porsenna, corrupted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">Pg 31</a></span>the youths of this town by making them effeminate buffoons, accompanied
by followers who carried the flabellum and umbrella.’</p>

<p>The fan, although perhaps in less constant use by the Romans, was
still an article of very general employment. In the <i>Eunuchus</i> of Terence
we are introduced to a pretty scene in which the fan plays an important part.
Chaerea is relating to Antipho his good fortune with the fair Thais:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Chaerea.</span> While I was revolving these things in my mind, the virgin meanwhile
was called away to bathe; she goes, bathes, and returns, after which they laid
her on a couch; I stand waiting to see if they had any orders for me. At last,
one came up and said—‘Here, Dorus, take this fan, and, while we are bathing,
fan her thus. When we have done you may bathe too, if you have a mind.’
I take it very demurely.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Antipho.</span> I could have then wished to see that impudent face of thine, and the
awkward figure so great a booby must make holding a fan.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Chaerea.</span> Scarce had she done speaking, when in a moment they all hurried out
of the room, and ran to the bath in a noisy manner, as is usual when masters
are absent. Meantime, the virgin falls asleep. I steal a private glance thus,
with the corner of my eye, through the fan; at the same time look round everywhere,
to see if the coast was quite clear....</p></blockquote>

<p>The Romans employed the fly-flap (<i>muscarium</i>) formed of peacocks’
feathers, which was often provided with a long handle, so that the fan could
be waved by a servant (<i>flabellifer</i>), who protected his mistress from the
insects during sleep.</p>

<p>Plautus, <i>Trinummus</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> i., refers to these <i>flabilliferae</i>, but in this
instance the term is obviously applied to female fan-bearers.</p>

<p>Propertius, <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> xxiv. 11, speaks of <i>flabella</i> of the tail feathers of the
peacock.</p>

<p>The peacock fly-flap is also referred to by Martial, xiv. 67:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">Pg 32</a></span></p>

<p>The same author, <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> lxxii. 10-11, says of Zoilus that when overcome by the
heat, a pleasant coolness is wafted about him with a leek-green flabellum.</p>

<p>The Romans also adopted the tail of the yak, but this last, which
appears to have been imported from India, was not so commonly used as
the tabellæ, a species of fan of square or circular shape, formed of precious
wood or very finely cut ivory, referred to by Ovid in the third book of
his <i>Amores</i>. ‘Wouldst thou,’ he exclaims, ‘have an agreeable zephyr to
refresh thy face? This tablet agitated by my hand will give you this
pleasure.’ Those also were the fans the young Roman exquisites
carried when accompanying their mistresses along the Via Sacra, fanning
them gallantly, representations of which appear on vases in the Louvre.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>Propertius, also, in the fourth book of his <i>Elegies</i>, represents Hercules
as seated at the feet of Omphale, fan in hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>FANS OF THE FAR EAST</h3>

<h4>INDIA</h4>

<p><span class="figleft150" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_073.jpg" width="150" height="268" alt="" /></span>
It is difficult for the Western mind to realise
the degree of importance assumed by the fan,
the fly-flap, and the umbrella, in the countries
of the Far East, especially India; these
objects being regarded with an affection
almost, indeed actually, amounting to reverence.
Its primal cause is to be found in
the overpowering insistence of the sun’s rays,
and the sense of grateful relief afforded by
shade and disturbance of the air. To discover
its origin we must look back, beyond
the age of legendary lore, to actual mythology,
when we find representations of the Puranic
snake gods of India with the sacred umbrella
over their heads, attended by Cherubim waving the fan and the fly-flap.
Similarly we find the sacred five- or seven-headed cobra itself assuming
the office of sunshade, uprearing its hood to form a canopy for Buddha
or for the Hindoo gods.</p>

<p>In the <i>Mahábhárata</i>, the ancient epic of Hindostan, we have a
description of the death of the monarch Pândou, in which great crowds
assemble at the bier to do homage to the dead, bringing offerings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">Pg 34</a></span>
fly-flaps and white umbrellas, the latter having each a hundred ribs of
pure gold, the donors thereby ensuring for themselves a place in
Paradise.</p>

<p>In the same epic, the poet represents the sacred Karna, in the midst
of the acclamations of victory, seated majestically upon his throne,
beneath the emblems of the umbrella, the fan, and the fly-flap; these
being regarded as the most solemn symbols of state throughout the
East.</p>

<p>Thus, the title of the King of Burmah is ‘Lord of the twenty-four
umbrellas,’ this being the number always borne before the Emperor of
China upon every state occasion, and accompanying him even to the
hunting-field.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>The connection between this umbrella-reverence and primitive tree-worship
is abundantly established, both having their origin in climatic
conditions. On the Sanchi Tope is figured the sacred flowering Sal
tree (beneath which Gautama Buddha died at Kasia), surmounted by
two <i>Chhatras</i>, these, together with the tree, being adorned with garlands.
Again, on the Great Tope at Buddha Gaya, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 250, erected in front of
the sacred Bo tree (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>), beneath which Gautama attained
to the Buddhahood, are umbrellas hung with garlands. Also in a
Thibetan picture of the death of Gautama given in Dr. Waddell’s
<i>Buddhism of Thibet</i>, we see a garlanded and festooned umbrella in
the centre over Buddha, with attendants waving fly-flaps, and on the right
a large standard fan.</p>

<p>So deeply rooted, indeed, is the reverence for the umbrella, and so
completely in the minds of the populace are these objects identified with
regal power, that, upon the occasion of the visit of the Prince of Wales
(King Edward <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>) to India, it was deemed necessary for his Royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">Pg 35</a></span>Highness to appear beneath a golden umbrella on an elephant in order
that his sovereign dignity might be demonstrated.</p>

<p>In the manuscript of Nieder Muenster of Ratisbon, now in the
library at Munich, we find a curious blending of the tree and umbrella
form, introduced as accessories in representations of the four evangelists,
doubtless merely intended as conventional floral forms, but evidently the
work of some monkish illuminator who had become influenced by
Oriental mythology.</p>

<p>In Ratisbon, also, is an illumination of Christ bearing the cross, to
one arm of which is attached a half-closed umbrella, reproduced in
<i>Curiosités Mystérieuses</i>. ‘Le pommeau,’ says the chronicler, ‘est orné
de ce que les Romains nomment Ombrellino (petit dais en parasol). S’il
s’agissait à coup sûr de ce baldaquin (qui est le propre de certains dignitaires)
nous pourrions rappeler que ce mot figurait déjà dans l’étiquette
impériale avant Constantin.’<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>On Attic and other Greek vases of the third and fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>,
to quote Sir George Birdwood, it is often very difficult to distinguish the
fan from the umbrella. ‘Where it is distinctly an umbrella, it is either
of the peaked Assyrian form, or of the dome-(‘rondel’ of Valentijin, etc.,
and ‘arundels’ of Fryer) topped Indian form (chhatra); and when it is
distinctly a fan, it is usually of the Indian type, determined by the fan
palm frond and the peacock feather, and rarely of the Egyptian type
determined by the date-palm and the ostrich feather.’</p>

<p>In the early Persian bas-reliefs, says Chardin in his <i>Voyages</i>, the kings
of Persia are frequently represented in the act of mounting on horseback
surrounded by beautiful slaves; the duty of one being that of holding an
umbrella over the head of the monarch. This, not only for the purpose of
protecting the sovereign from the rays of the sun, but also to demonstrate
his absolute right of life and death over both prisoners and subjects.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">Pg 36</a></span></p>
<p>Umbrellas formed an important feature in the Greek Bacchic processions.
Aristophanes refers to white umbrellas and baskets, signifying
pomp and joy, as being intended to recall to men the acts of Ceres and
Proserpine, and constantly borne by virgins at all religious ceremonials.</p>

<p>In a miniature in the Royal Library at Paris, of Sivaji on the march,
a sayiban or sun-fan is seen, having an arrangement of drapery in form
of a curtain or valance.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Here we discover a point of contact between
the fan and the umbrella, although it is probable that in this instance its
use as a shade-giving instrument had not developed.</p>

<p>A much closer form-connection, however, between fan and umbrella
is seen in the simple leaf section of the Palmyra palm, cut level at the
top, used by the natives in most parts of India. This assumes exactly
the shape of the pleated fan, the pleating formed by Nature’s deft hands.
The large Cingalese umbrella used by headsmen and at weddings is
of the same shape, made of the young leaves of the talipot palm, often
richly decorated with plaited patterns in various colours, and with mica
inlay. Of similar form, also, is the sacred processional parasol of the
Indian Mussulmans (Shia sect) and the Hindus.</p>

<p>The fan, therefore, must be considered as part of a continuous development
from the umbrella symbol of might and power, employed
equally in the East as in the West, and the infinitude of military and
processional fan-like standards and sceptral fans, to the hand-fan and
fly-whisk.</p>

<p>We discover a direct affinity between the hissing of the wind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">Pg 37</a></span>through the open metal mouth and silken bag of the Roman Dragon
standard, and the beating of the wings of the Norse Raven, used for a
similar purpose; between the Assyrian disc standards with the divine archer
standing on the sacred bull, and the cruciferal discs employed at a more

recent date in Christian Church ceremonial;
between the chauri waved over the head of
Krishna, and the wafting of divine influence
by the angelic attendants upon the Saviour
in early Christian missal-painting.</p>

<p>The <i>alums</i> or <i>allums</i> used in the
Moharram procession in India are analogous
to the standards used by the Greeks and
Romans, and those figured on the gates of
the Sanchi Tope, consisting not only of
flags and banners, but of all sorts of devices
in metal, raised on the top of a long staff
and carried to battle.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>The Cingalese Sēsata, a ceremonial fan
for royal and religious use, or for attendance
upon great personages, consists of an embroidered
cloth disc, or talipot leaf, decorated
with images of the sun, moon, etc., with mica
and other materials introduced, mounted on
a lacquered staff. Tenants of the first rank
attend the Disvāta (lord chief) on journeys,
convey his orders, carrying the great banner,
state umbrella, and Sēsata.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> A smaller
disc-fan, the disc covered with crimson velvet, the handle about fifteen
inches long, of carved ivory, richly inlaid, occurs in the Louvre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">Pg 38</a></span></p>

<p>The royal standard, banner, or ensign, employed in India, composed of
peacocks’ feathers, is illustrated in a MS. copy of the Akbar-Namah (<i>c.</i> 1597),
the form being circular, and also that of a somewhat elongated semicircle.</p>

<p>The fly-flap, chowr, chowrie, chourie, chaurie, is next in dignity to
the umbrella, and was in the first instance devoted to the service of the
<span class="figleft50" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/i_078a.jpg" width="50" height="170" alt="" /></span>
gods. On a bas-relief of the pagoda of Elephanta, described
by the Orientalist Langlés in his <i>History of Hindostan</i>, a
servant is seen behind Brahma and Indra holding in each hand
chauries or fly-whisks. In the India Museum is a charming
little chaurie with silver handle and ribbons of silver gauze
tipped with red silk, used by Jains to drive away insects from
their idol without destroying them.</p>

<p>Chauries are formed of various materials—of ivory, the
strips of which are sometimes cut to incredible fineness for
such a substance; in these cases the handles are formed of
the same material, richly carved—of the bushy tail of the
<span class="figright125" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/i_078b.jpg" width="125" height="196" alt="" />
<span class="caption">(From a painting on talc. Madras.

Himalayan yak, both black and white, the handles
either of metal, ivory, or wood—of sandalwood,
also cut into the finest possible strips, the handles
richly carved; the waving of these chauries
emitting a fine fragrance—of the stripped quills
of the larger birds, more generally the peacock—of
horse-hair and the various grasses. The handles
were often formed of the horns of various
animals; an example occurs in the Horniman
Museum, in which instance it is the antelope.
The chaurie from the tail of the yak was in
ancient India fixed upon a gold or ornamented
shaft between the ears of the war-horse, like the
plume of the war-horse of chivalry; the banner or banneret, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">Pg 39</a></span>device of the chief, rose at the back of the car. ‘The waving chaurie
on the steed’s broad brow points backwards, motionless as a picture.’<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>This, it will be seen, is in strict conformity to the usage of the
ancient Egyptians, who employed the tall fan emblem in a precisely
similar way; these proud plumes serving a double purpose—an ornamental,
and, in the case of Egypt, even an heraldic purpose, and also the
purely utilitarian one of affording the animal some relief from fly pests.</p>

<p>The peacock has ever been regarded as a sacred bird, both by the
peoples of the East and the West. The Greek fable of Argus the
hundred-eyed, the sleepless guardian of Io, serves to connect the idea of
extreme vigilance with that of true kingship, <i>i.e.</i> the universal preserver
and father of the people. The peacock therefore presented a double significance
to the minds of the Hindu peoples; it expressed the vigilance
of kingship together with its magnificence. The peacock feather emblem
of royalty is the sign or insignia of the king’s high office, and the

principal evidence of his sovereignty: wherever a king appears
he is accompanied by an attendant bearing this emblem,
which appears in all pictorial or other representations of
royalty.</p>

<p>It was, doubtless, in the first instance a fly-flap, and is
either composed entirely of feathers, or, it consists of a bunch
of feathers enclosed two-thirds of the distance in a silver
casing, usually ornamented with an imbricated pattern; the
handle also of silver. Several examples of this object appear
in the India Museum, and numberless representations occur
in sculpture, illumination, embroidery, etc.</p>

<p>The poet Valmiki tells of the sumptuous sceptre, studded
with jewels, prepared for the sacrifices to Rama—a magnificent fan with
a radiant garland resembling the full moon in the clear night sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">Pg 40</a></span></p>
<p>The word punkhá, or pankhá, from pankh, a feather, a bird, is a
generic term applied in India to all fans, pankhi meaning a small fan.
This derivation serves as an indication of the early use of the plumed fan
in India, which divides honours with the palm-leaf fan in point of
antiquity, and doubtless also as suggesting a similarity between the
beating of a bird’s wings and the movement of the fan.</p>

<p>The earliest plumed fans probably consisted of a pair of complete
wings set shoulder to shoulder, resembling the caduceus of Mercury,
which was regarded as a symbol of happiness, peace, and concord, the
wings expressing diligence.</p>

<p>Feather-fans assume all manner of shapes, as the large round banner-fans
already referred to; the familiar crescent-like form with a short
<span class="figleft200" style="width: 200px;">

handle set horizontally at its base;
and the various hand-screens, these
either composed entirely of peacocks’
feathers, the breast and
neck feathers forming a pattern
in the centre, with a border of
tail feathers; or, the centre formed
of plaited pith and cane of various
colours, beetles’ wings, etc., with
the border again of feathers; the
handles being of cane or wood,
or of wood covered with cane strippings or other material.</p>

<p>In Persia and Arabia, from the first centuries of our era, fans were
made of ostrich feathers, many being ornamented with that form of inscription
which is such a leading feature of the decorative art of these
countries.<br /><br /></p>

<p>The crescent-shaped hand-fan also dates from a very early period.
In its primitive form, it is seen in the painted decoration of the Bud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">Pg 41</a></span>dhist
<span class="figright125" style="width: 125px;">

cave-temples of Ajanta (first century B.C. to eighth century A.D.),
the example given being probably ornamented with strips or panels of
mica, the constructional portion of cane or pith.</p>

<p>A variant of this form, still more simple in
its construction, is seen in one of the sculptured
roundels of the Buddhist tope at Amaravati,
Southern India, <i>circa</i> second century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>; an
attendant upon a great personage waves a circular
fan, having the handle stretched across the face,

<span class="caption">PLAITED GRASS-FAN<br />(From the Amaravati Tope.)</span></span>
with a circular opening near the lower edge to
enable the handle to be gripped. All the foregoing
types obtain at the present day, and are
as modern as they are ancient.</p>

<p>The flag form of fan is, if possible, a still
more remarkable instance of the persistence of
certain decorative <i>motifs</i> throughout long periods
of the world’s history. This type, again, is in
use at the present day—the page of
examples illustrated are of the mid-nineteenth century—this

identical form appears in the wall-paintings at Ajanta;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> it is
also seen in Egyptian and Assyrian sculptured reliefs; it was
employed by the Copts from the third to the sixth century,
and earlier in Arabia; it was in general use in Italy during
the period of the Renaissance. There can be no possibility
of doubt that this form of fan was common to the whole of
the East and to a greater portion of the West, and has
endured throughout the centuries.</p>

<p>These fans are of two kinds—rigid and flexible; in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">Pg 42</a></span>

both instances they are invariably plaited, the material being stripped
palm, bamboo, ivory, peacock quills, etc. The rigid variety is often placed
loose in the handle, to allow of its being swung round and round like
a policeman’s rattle. See illustration opposite.</p>

<p>The hatchet or halberd shape is a development of the flag form, and
varies from the simple blade to that of a highly ornamental shape. The
material is silk, velvet, cloth or other tissue, often richly embroidered
with gold and silver thread, spangles,
beetles’ wings, etc., with a fringe
of either silver tinsel or peacocks’
feathers; the handles being of wood,
cane, or silver. These are at present
largely made at Delhi.</p>

<p>Occasionally the fan is entirely
formed of threaded glass beads of
various colours forming a pattern
upon a wire framework, with a fringe
of tinsel, the handle also overlaid
with beads.</p>

<p>The primitive palm-fan occurs on
the oldest Hindostani bas-reliefs, and
is described by the poets. This
primeval fan still forms part of the
attire of certain Buddhist priests in
Siam, and from it they take their
name of ‘Talapoins’; the fan’s name
being ‘talapat,’ or ‘palm-tree-leaf’ in
the Siamese language.</p>

<p>This form (the reversed heart) is common to both the smaller hand-fans
and the larger ceremonial and processional fans. The natural palm-leaf
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">Pg 43</a></span>
is employed, trimmed to the required shape, and used either plain, or
painted in brilliant colours, or forming a base for a covering of embroidery,
feathers or stuffs, as in the example from Moorshedabad
(illustrated), which is of velvet, embroidered with silver.</p>

The lateral form, in which the leaf is
set sidewise on the stem, follows the same
principle of decorative development. It is
used plain, painted, inlaid with talc as in
the example illustrated, is embroidered with
silk, spangles, beetles’ wings, etc.; it also
supplies the shape or decorative <i>motif</i> for
fans of a different material, as in the instance
of the four long-handled fans, forming
portion of the Burmese regalia, obtained from
Mandalay in 1885, examples of a barbaric
splendour only to be found in the gorgeous
East. These are of gold, jewelled with rubies
and the ‘nan-ratan’ or nine stone, the handles
overlaid with gold and also jewelled.</p>

<p>Amongst fans formed of the more precious
materials is a disc-shaped fan of gold, set
with cabochon sapphires, an offering dedicated
by Kīrti Ṡri to the ‘Tooth relic.’<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Figured

studded with jewels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">Pg 44</a></span></p>
<p>Fans are also made of the sweet-scented Khaskhás root (<i>Andropogon
muricatus</i>), and as these are generally used after being wetted, they impart
to the air a cool fragrance; they are often highly ornamented with gold
and silver spangles, gold thread, tinsel, beetles’ wings, etc., and occasionally
provided with ivory handles. A pretty example occurs at Kew, where
there is an excellent collection of fans made of the various vegetable substances.
Fans of talc, decorated with exquisite illumination, were made
at Tanjore during the eighteenth century. Specimens occur in the India
Museum, South Kensington.</p>

<p>Representations of the fan are of constant occurrence in Indian
work, both illumination, embroidery, sculpture, and other material. On a
curiously primitive embroidered napkin from Chamba, we are introduced
to the worship of a Hindu deity—a king and queen are kneeling under a
palm-tree, the god Ganesh in the distance with flag-fan; an attendant
bears the peacock feather emblem of royalty, a second attendant waves
a large heart-shaped fan. On a small mat or pad of enamelled leather
(Hyderabad, nineteenth century), we see a whimsical combination of
Krishna and his damsels forming the similitude of an elephant, the
umbrella, pankhá, and two fly-flappers being in evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">Pg 45</a></span></p>

<p>A beautiful illumination from a MS. copy of the Akbar-Namah, above
quoted, shows a prince seated upon his throne in the act of receiving
offerings; an attendant waves a fly-flap behind the throne, a second
attendant bears one of the large pankhás beautifully embroidered in gold
and colours.</p>

<p>We are also in another illumination introduced to a beautiful flowered
parterre, in which a Mongol princess is seated before a rippling fountain;
attendants wait upon her with fruits, vases containing unguents, spices,
etc.; behind, a female attendant waves the fly-flap.</p>

<p>In the decoration of the entrance gate of the temple at Ajmir, a
prince appears in a howdah on the back of an elephant, an attendant sits
behind waving a fly-flap, a second flabellifer is seated on the head of the
animal; the prince himself holds a small fan in his hand, an attendant on
foot bears the pankhá, and another the insignia of royalty.</p>

<p>Fair and delicate though these creations of Eastern ingenuity may be,
the genius of Oriental imagery and fancy has discovered for us a still
more delicate and effective instrument—a Sanskrit poet recounts a graceful
fable of a princess of extreme beauty, who, although constantly
attending and fanning the divine fire with a view to increasing the prosperity
of her father, never succeeded in producing a flame save by the
breath of her charming lips.</p>

Chinese authorities are at variance concerning the invention
of the fan, which has been attributed to the
Emperor Hsien Yüan, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2697; to the Emperor Shun,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2255, and to the first ruler of the Chou dynasty,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1122.</p>

<p>According to a Chinese legend, it had its origin
at the Feast of Lanterns, where, on an occasion when
the heat became particularly oppressive, the beautiful
daughter of a mandarin took off her mask, and agitated
it so as to fan the air into a gentle breeze; the rest of
the fair revellers were so much struck with the grace of
the motion that they one and all let fall their masks
and followed the example of the mandarin’s daughter.</p>

<p>The earliest fans were of the dyed feathers of various
birds, and those of the peacock. We have an account
of a present of two fans of feathers of ‘tsio rouge,’
offered to the Emperor Tchao-wang of the Chou dynasty, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1052, by
the King of Thou-sieou, and it is affirmed in the ‘Tchéou-li’ that one
of the chariots of the empress carried a feather-fan for the purpose of
keeping the wheels free from dust.</p>

<p>The poet Thou-fou, in the ‘Song of Autumn,’ refers to fans of
pheasants’ feathers as in royal use. The Emperor Kao-Tsong, of the
Chang dynasty, 1323-1266 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, having heard the cry of the pheasant,
an omen of good luck, resolved thenceforth to use only fans composed
of the tail feathers of this bird.</p>

screen at the Victoria and Albert
Museum, representing the Taoist Genii
worshipping the god of Longevity, and
constantly figures in pictorial and other representations.</p>

<p>Similar fans with several rows of pointed feathers
appear in painted and decorative work; a curious
example being seen in a large drawing from Tonkin
(Louvre). The outer row of feathers, white and pale
blue; the second, yellow; the third, those of the peacock;
the body of the fan, green, red, white, and

<p>In the lacquered screen above referred to, a large
fan of this character is waved over the head of one of
the devotees riding aloft on a cloud, wending his

<p>The feather-fan is one of the chief attributes of Hsi Wang Mu, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">Pg 48</a></span>
famed Queen of the Genii (Royal Mother of the West), whose dwelling
was a mountain palace in Central Asia, where she held Court with her
fairy legions and received the great Taoist Rishis and certain favoured
mortals, and whose amours with the Han Emperor Wu Ti have given
much occupation for both author and artist.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

fan forms are, unquestionably, taken from older Chinese originals.</p>

<p>The earliest illustrations, however, of this personage and her fan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">Pg 49</a></span>
and probably the oldest representations of fans in Chinese art, are
those of the sculptures of the Han dynasty, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 206-<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 25. In these,
Hsi-wang Mu, wearing a coroneted hat, is attended by ladies carrying
cup, mirror, and fan. On the same relief the Emperor Mu Wang of the
Chou dynasty, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1001, is attended by a servitor with fan and towel
or handkerchief. In the frieze forming the lower part of the relief,
we see the ‘Chariot of the Sage’ preceded by two men on foot, with
staves and fans.</p>

<p>On another of these reliefs, representing the discovery of one of the
sacred bronze tripods, the ancient palladia of the kingdom, the two commissioners
deputed by the Emperor to superintend its recovery from the
river are attended by servitors bearing fans. These are the small hand-screens
(pien-mien) described by M. Rondot as being larger in the upper
part, their shape approaching that of a reversed trapezium with the angles
rounded off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">Pg 50</a></span></p>

<p>This same author refers to four screens of white jade (regarded by
the Chinese as the most precious of precious stones), the handles of an
odoriferous amber, that were offered by the Emperor Chun-Hi of the
Southern Sung dynasty, 1174-1190, to his Empress. At this time the
screens were ornamented with incrustation and inscription, which was
much esteemed, and this author quotes a curious passage from the <i>Annals
of the Thsi</i> to the effect that Wang-sun-pen, of Kin-ling, represented in the
space of a few inches a perspective view of rivers, mountains, valleys, and
plains, stretching over a thousand miles of land. These screen pictures are
referred to in the <i>Ku yü t’ou pu</i>, an illustrated catalogue of ancient jade, in
one hundred books, compiled in 1176 by an imperial commission headed
by Lung Ta-Yuan, President of the Board of Rites.</p>

<p>The small hand-screens assume a variety of forms—circular, pear-shaped,
heart-shaped, etc., and are made of various materials, as—(1) The
natural palm leaf, seen in the Chinese painting, British Museum, 37.
(2) The palm leaf cut to various shapes, with a bamboo handle running
up the middle, as in the Japanese example given on page 61. (3) Of bamboo;
from Chinese records we learn that on the fifth day of the fifth month of the
year corresponding to our 219, the Emperor presented to the members of
the Imperial Academy a fan of bamboo, carved and painted blue. There is
also a record of an existing fan of oblong form, made of bamboo leaf,
ornamented with bulrushes, an inscription on the field of the fan. This
dates from the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> (4) Of the turtle shell: the two portions
held together with metal plates, with a wooden or other handle, examples
of which occur in the Musée Guimet, Paris. (5) Of silk stretched upon a
frame, with painted or other decoration, as in the two charming examples
illustrated from the collection of Mr. W. Crewdson. Both front and reverse
are given: the latter decorated in that system of feather-work much affected
by the Chinese, and in which they display great skill. The feathers are
usually the turquoise tinted plumes of the kingfisher: in the present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">Pg 51</a></span>
instance the design is alternated by an imbrication of peacocks’ feathers.
The handles are of carved ivory.</p>

<p>There are also the cockade screens, usually of ivory or sandalwood.</p>

<p>Representations of the earlier large ceremonial banner screens appear
on a carved pedestal of a Buddhist image, Northern Wei dynasty, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
524; these are oval in form, and are seen in both sculptured and painted
representations down to recent times.</p>

<p>In the Musée Guimet in Paris is a large fan of red lacquer framework
(reversed heart shape) enclosing a series of metal ribs through which the
wind plays; in the centre are painted dragons.</p>

<p>Among the painted representations in the India Museum, of objects
from the Summer Palace at Pekin, is a circular screen, ‘like the moon,’
borne by the guard of an imperial concubine. See illustration, p. 46.</p>

<p>A favourite device for the decoration of these larger screens is that of
the fabled Phœnix, the Ho bird of the Japanese. This is seen in the painting
of the Chinese school of Japan, British Museum, 822, in which one
of the two attendants on a Chinese Emperor carries a long oval screen
bordered with peacocks’ feathers, and ornamented with two Phœnixes.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>We therefore perceive that the ceremonies and customs relating to the
fan, no less than the various forms which this instrument assumed, were
practically identical with the ancient peoples of the East and West;—the
same order of development, having its origin in the natural suggestion
afforded by the wings of birds and of the broader leaved plants; the fans
of the Han dynasty reliefs, their exact counterpart being found in Egypt
and Assyria; the rigid hand-screens corresponding to those tabellæ
which the Romans derived from the Greeks, who in turn received them</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">Pg 52</a></span></p>
<p>from the peoples of Asia Minor, and which, doubtless, had their origin in
the more remote East; the employment of the fan in both religious and
civil ceremonial and in war.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>Among the Bat Bu’u (eight precious things) carried at the end of staves
by the inhabitants of Annam in their ceremonial processions, is a fan (Quat)
symbolising the graceful perfection of the form of woman, and the light
breeze that tempers the heat of the summer sun.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> These Bat Bu’u are
made in three ways—</p>

<p>
1. Of carved wood lacquered and gilt.<br />
2. Of tin or pewter.<br />
3. In the form of transparencies to be lighted from within.<br />

procession.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>The invention of the folding-fan is generally credited to the ingenious
little inhabitants of the land of the rising sun; its date, however, as well
as its precise character, is impossible to determine with anything approaching
to accuracy. Tradition says that it was designed by an artist
who lived in the reign of the Emperor Jen-ji, about 670 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D</span>., and was
formed upon the principle of the construction of a bat’s wing, this being
in conformity with the general usage of Japanese designers, who derived
their artistic <i>motifs</i> from natural constructive forms. The date of its introduction
into China is also a matter of considerable uncertainty: we have
a reference to it in a Chinese work of the date 960, to the effect that the
tsin-theou-chen, or folding-fan, was introduced by Tchang-ping-hai, and
was supposed to be offered as a tribute by the barbarians of the south-east,
who came, holding in their hands the pleated fan, which occasioned
much laughter and ridicule. All Chinese authors agree, however, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">Pg 53</a></span>
it was the invention of foreigners, <i>i.e.</i> the Japanese, who, together with
the Tartars, possessed folding-fans before they were known in China.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>M. Rondot records the fact that at first, only courtesans made use
of folding-fans, honest women carried round screens.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>Since the appearance of the folding-fan, various materials have been
pressed into its service, including ivory, tortoise-shell, lacquer, mother
of pearl, the various woods—especially sandalwood, the more precious
metals, silk, skin, and paper.</p>

<p>No nation possesses a keener appreciation of ivory as a vehicle for
artistic expression than the Chinese, whose carved balls in concentric
spheres of open work are the wonder of western peoples. Ivory fans
date from a very remote period, it is believed as early as 990 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and
are marvels of patient ingenuity.</p>

<p>The Imperial Ivory Works within the palace at Peking was founded
toward the close of the seventeenth century, and became the centre for
the best production in this delicate material.</p>

<p>Ivory fans are either of pierced flat open work, or elaborately carved
with subjects, the backgrounds of which are formed by delicate ribbing,
imparting a lightness and softness to the fan not obtainable by any other
means. An extraordinarily skilful example is the cockade-fan in the Wyatt
collection at South Kensington; this, together with several others in the
same collection, have monograms in cursive European characters, and
were executed to the order of Europeans. In each instance the blades
are connected by means of a ribbon running through the whole. One</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">Pg 54</a></span></p>

<p>example only of these fans is given; that bearing the word ‘Angela’—fitting
name of the gentle lady whose memory is revered wherever the
English language is spoken.</p>

<p>Tortoise-shell is carved with the same consummate skill as ivory, and
on the same principle of delicate piercing and ribbing. Two such fans
occur in the Wyatt collection, profusely decorated in relief with figures of
horsemen, buildings, boats, and flowers. The material, which is softened
both by warm water and dry heat, is obtained from the loggerhead turtle
of the Malay Archipelago and Indian Ocean, and imported to Canton, a
centre both for tortoise-shell and ivory workers. An extremely effective
and picturesque fan is that in the same collection, formed of the feathers
of the Argus pheasant, cut short to the fan shape, the sticks of carved
tortoise-shell. In this the colours of the feathers harmonise extremely well
with the translucent red brown of the tortoise-shell.</p>

<p>This material is also lacquered, one of the earliest and most prized
of the Chinese arts, and the technique of which is fully described in the
<i>Ko ku yao lun</i>, a learned work on antiquities published in the reign of
Hung Wu, the founder of the Ming dynasty, 1387. This substance is
obtained from the lac-tree (<i>Rhus vernicifera</i>), cultivated for the purpose
throughout Central and Southern China. The tree exudes a resinous
sap that becomes black upon its exposure to the air, the sap being
extracted from the tree at night, during the summer months, and dried,
ground, and strained through hempen cloth to an evenly flowing liquid,
which is applied by the brush.</p>

<p>Gold plays an important part both in the composition of the lacquer
itself, to which it imparts a richness and pellucidity which is extremely
beautiful, and also in its subsequent decoration. The fan and case of
Canton lacquer in the Wyatt collection are richly decorated with panels
of buildings and gardens, on a diapered background, overlaid with flowers,
butterflies, and other devices, and are excellent examples of Chinese gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">Pg 55</a></span>
lacquer, an art which, although originating in China, has been somewhat
neglected, and has, at a later period, been brought by the Japanese to a
greater perfection than the Chinese have at any time attained.</p>

<p>Sandalwood is largely employed for fans, on account of its lightness,
the ease with which it is worked, and also its fine aroma. The tree
is indigenous to India, and is imported by the Chinese, who employ it for
a variety of purposes, including the perfumed joss-sticks which are common
throughout the East. These fans are worked on the same principle
of flat piercing as those of ivory. They are also carved in relief, but can
scarcely be said to rival the last-named substance with its delicate variety
of translucent softness. The large fan at South Kensington is a good
example.</p>

<p>Mother of pearl is a favourite material for fan-sticks on account of its
beautiful play of iridescent colour. A number of fans of Chinese workmanship,
both of mother of pearl and ivory, have found their way to
Europe and have been remounted. Such a fan is that in the Wyatt collection
with a subject finely painted on chicken skin by Eugène André.</p>

<p>Bamboo has already been referred to as in early use. It is extensively
employed for the cheaper fans on account of its durability as
well as cheapness. The number of ribs vary from sixteen to thirty-six;
the former may be regarded as the standard number.</p>

<p>The art of filigree is practised by the Chinese with the most consummate
skill; it is occasionally in gold, but more often in silver gilt, the
gilding being employed for the double purpose of preventing tarnishing
and for decorative effect. Filigree work is often enriched by means of
inlay, either enamel, or the turquoise feathers of the kingfisher, which
latter, however, are merely gummed on the surface of the metal, and, as
a consequence, are wanting in durability.</p>

<p>Enamelling has been practised in western Asia from a very early
period, <i>i.e.</i> previous to the Christian era, and is believed to have reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">Pg 56</a></span>
China about the thirteenth century. There are two kinds, both accomplished
by the process known as incrustation—cloisonné, in which the
pattern is raised on the surface of the metal by soldering on to it metal
or wire strips of copper, silver, or gold, thus forming a series of cells or
cloisons; and champlevé, in which the cell-walls enclosing the pattern are
either modelled and cast, or cut and hollowed out of the metal itself by
means of graving tools: in both, the pattern is filled in with enamel.</p>

<p>Of the colours, there are two well-contrasted shades of blue—a dark
tint made from cobalt and resembling the lapis-lazuli tone, and a light
sky blue or turquoise; several greens made from copper, a dark coral red,
a fine yellow, black, and white.</p>

<p>Chinese enamels are usually fired in the open courtyard, protected
only by a primitive cover of iron network, the charcoal fire being regulated
by a number of men standing round with large fans in their hands.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>Of the interesting fans in which the combined arts of filigree and
enamel are employed we give a charming example from the Wyatt collection
at South Kensington. In this, the effective colour scheme is that of the
two blues and gold; the design being a conventional rendering of a Phœnix
and foliage. In the colour plate given of the fan in the collection of Mr.
M. Tomkinson, the leaf has a large cartouche in the centre representing
a Chinese garden, with the hostess welcoming a visitor who has arrived
on horseback, the servant bringing tea. On either side are small medallions
of a sun-dial and a broken column, evidently introduced to the
order of a European patron.</p>

<p>Of the familiar class of fans having large compositions of figures
of which the heads are of applied ivory, painted, the costumes of silk
appliqué, the sticks of ivory elaborately carved, the example illustrated
from the collection of Mr. Burdett-Coutts belonged to a mandarin of
the first rank. A beautiful example was formerly in the possession of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">Pg 57</a></span>
H.I.M. the Empress Eugénie,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> the stick of sandalwood. The brins
of these fans, twelve in number, are occasionally varied, as follows:—Two
of white ivory, pierced and carved; two of silver filigree and
enamel; two of ivory, pierced and carved, coloured scarlet; two of tortoise-shell,
carved and pierced; two of engraved white pearl; and two of
gilt filigree enamel. The panaches of gilt filigree, with silver dragons
in relief. An example occurs in the collection of Mr. Messel, another
was in the possession of the late Mr. R. W. Edis.</p>

<p>Almost every important city or district in China has its characteristic
fan—something distinctive in the make, colour, or ornamentation of the
folding-fan, which is the fan <i>par excellence</i> in the Chinese mind. The
convenience of this fan will at once be apparent—it occupies but little
space, it may, when not in use, be stuck in the high boot of the full-dressed
Chinaman, or in the ample folds of his dress.</p>

<p>These fans are made to suit every class of society from mandarin to
peasant—to suit the changing seasons, in different sizes in proportion to
the quantity of breeze required. The Son of Heaven, during the sultry
summer months, employs fans of feathers, and during winter of silk.
Fashion, however, lays down inexorable laws as to the time and period
of their use, and to be seen with a fan too early or too late in the year is
considered as <i>mauvais ton</i>. A poem by Ow-Yang Hisu informs us that
‘In the tenth moon the people of the capital turn to their warm fans.’</p>

<p>During the warm weather the fan forms part of the ceremony of
tea-drinking; the host takes his fan as soon as tea is drunk, and, bowing
to the company, says, ‘Thsing-chen’ (I invite you to fan yourselves);
each guest immediately using his fan with great gravity and modesty.
It is considered a breach of etiquette to be without a fan on such an
occasion, or to refrain from its use.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">Pg 58</a></span></p>

<p>The Chinese have exhausted every species of ingenuity in the construction
of fans of an <i>outré</i> character. The ‘broken fan,’ a curious trick,
is to all intents and purposes a simple folding-fan, and opened from left
to right presents no feature uncommon. On being opened to the <i>reverse</i>,
the whole fan appears to fall to pieces, each bone, with the part attached,
being separated from the other as though the connecting strings were
broken: the principle is extremely simple, but the effect is surprising.</p>

<p>A fan which has been styled the ‘impracticable,’ is of circular form,
the radiants of ivory, tortoise-shell, sandalwood, or metal filigree, perforated
to such a degree as to render it useless as a means of disturbing
the air. These are elaborately carved with figures, scroll-work, and other
designs, or with birds, flowers, etc., in silver gilt filigree.</p>

<p>The ‘double-entente’ fan, opened in the ordinary manner, exhibits
some harmless <i>motif</i> such as a flower, bird, or landscape; opened the
reverse way, it discloses a ribald sketch that would entail severe penalties
on its maker if discovered. The Peking variety shows two such pictures
which are not seen when the fan is opened, but are disclosed by turning
back the two end ribs of the fan.</p>

<p>The ‘dagger-fan’ is an invention of the Japanese, its importation
into China being strictly forbidden. In its outward appearance it is
sufficiently harmless, being apparently an ordinary lacquered folding-fan:
in reality it is a sheath containing a deadly blade, short and sharp,
resembling a small Malay kris (see illustration facing page 60). These
dagger or stiletto fans are by no means confined to the East; in the
British Museum is a print of an Italian stiletto concealed in a case
made in imitation of a fan; the panaches of ivory, engraved with
Italian arabesques.</p>

of a couplet of eight characters written in the eight corners of an
octagon fan. On beginning at any one of the eight characters and
reading round the way of the sun, it forms a couplet of perfect sense

<p>A story is told of a favourite of the Emperor Ch’êng Ti of the Han
dynasty, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 32, whose name was Pan, and who for some time had been
a confidante of his Majesty and the Queen of the Imperial Seraglio.
Having persuaded herself that something more than an ordinary attachment
of the hour existed between herself and the ‘Son of Heaven,’
finding her influence on the wane and being unable to conceal any longer
her mortification, grief, and despair, she forwarded to the Emperor a
circular screen-fan, upon which were inscribed the following lines expressing
the contrast between the summer of her reciprocated love and
the autumn of her desertion:—</p>

THE fan is regarded by the Japanese as an emblem of life,

rivet or starting-point, and for this reason is selected
for the new-year’s gift.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> It enters into almost every

<p>The early history of the fan in the country of Dai Nippon is substantially
the same as in all the countries of the far and nearer East, and
presents us with the same order of development, the earliest being formed
of the primitive palm leaf, or of feathers. We have, in the story of ‘The
Tengus’ a description of the Dai or Master Tengu, who wears a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">Pg 61</a></span>
grey beard down to his girdle, moustaches to his chin, and carries in his left
hand as a sign of his rank a fan made of seven wide feathers pointed at the

<span class="caption f08">FEATHER-FAN<br />(From a Japanese painting. British Museum.)</span></span>
tip: this he waves while singing a song,
doubtless for the purpose of modulating his
voice. The fan is identical in form with
that of Chung-li Ch’uan, one of the eight
Taoist immortals, referred to on page 47.</p>

<p>The rigid screens received from China
at the close of the sixth century are referred
to in the earlier part of this chapter, under
China. Those in use in Japan present no
material difference to the Chinese except in
the details of their decorative significance.
The larger screens were employed both in

civil and religious ceremonial, as war standards,
and waved by servants in attendance upon
royal and distinguished personages. These
latter denoted the rank of the owner, the
material being of silk or other fabric stretched
over a wooden framework, painted or otherwise
decorated, the forms extremely varied,
but more usually those of the circle, oval, or
pear. The pear-shaped hand-screen is seen
in the hands of Hotei, the fat god of prosperity,
and of Juro, the god of longevity, as an
invariable accompaniment of those divinities.
An example is given from a portrait of Lü
T’ung-pin, a Taorist Rishi of the eighth
century, by Go-gaku, nineteenth century,
British Museum, 640. This has a red tassel or tail at the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">Pg 62</a></span>
fan, a kind of combination of fan and fly-whip. A similar fan appears in
a painting of the Caligraphic school, British Museum, 1617. This fan
is of Chinese origin, and is constantly represented in the art of that
country.</p>

<p>Fly-whips were also used. Of the representations of the sixteen Arhats
(Buddhist divinities) given in the ‘Butsu zō dzu-i,’ three hold fly-whips
(futsujin) in their hands. This instrument is also seen in the right hand of
Vimalakîrrti, an Indian priest, in the painting on silk attributed to
Shingetsu, Sesshiu school, fifteenth century, British Museum collection.</p>

<p>The fly-whip or chasse-mouche was also used by generals while on
horseback, this being made of strips of tough paper suspended from a
lacquered handle mounted with bronze.</p>

<p>A list of the more important varieties of Japanese fans, together with
the dates of their introduction, as given by native authorities, will probably
be of service.</p>

<p>The invention of the folding-fan has already been referred to. Its
earliest form is the Kōmori (bat), so named from the supposition of the wing
of this animal suggesting the principle of its construction. It is formed
of fifteen bamboo sticks having a slight re-divergence springing from
the handle end, so that when held closed in the hand as it is by courtiers
while fulfilling the office of fan-bearing, it still appears open. It is stated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">Pg 63</a></span>
that this spread-out form was adopted as court-fan on account of the misuse
of the dagger-fan. The mount is of paper, which may be painted with any
design in any colour except the unlucky green and light purple.</p>

</tr></table></div>

<p>One of the many traditions of its invention may be given. It is
attributed to a fan-maker of the Tenji period, 668-672, whose name is
forgotten, living at Tamba near Kyoto. He was married to a shrew, and
on a certain night a bat having found its way into the sleeping-room, the
woman reviled her husband for not getting up to throw the vampire out.
The animal coming in contact with the lamp, scorched its wings and fell to
the floor. As the man picked it up, the opening of the creature’s wings
suggested to him the principle of a folding-fan that might be carried in
one’s sleeve.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>The Suye hiro ogi (wide end) has a similar divergence to the foregoing,
with the addition of a slight curve or rounding of the outward sticks. It
was used for the dances in the Nō drama; the number of sticks varying
from fifteen to twenty-five. This also dates from the seventh century.
The example illustrated is decorated with a series of crests of various
families on a gold ground. In a drawing by Bun-chin, nineteenth century,
British Museum, 891, of Performers in the ‘Nō’ Theatre, is represented a
beautiful fan of a peacock with outspread tail and branches of bamboo,
in gold, blue, and green. This fan is of the ordinary shape.</p>

<p>The Akomé ogi is the earlier court-fan, and dates from the invention of
the folding-fan in the seventh century. It consists of thirty-eight blades of
wood painted white, decorated with cherry, pine, plum, or chrysanthemum,
on a ground of gold and silver powder, ‘among the mist.’ The fan is
ornamented at the corners with an arrangement of artificial flowers in silk,
with twelve long streamers of different coloured silks; the rivet is formed of
either a bird or butterfly. This type of fan was in use by the court ladies
until 1868.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">Pg 64</a></span></p>
<p>By the courtesy of Mr. W. Crewdson we are enabled to reproduce one
of these rare fans, bearing the following inscription:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘The decorations at the end of this Akomé-ogi show that it was used by a court
lady. At Kioto, the Mikado’s Palace had Lemon trees at the right-hand side of the
entrance and Cherry trees at the left; hence these ornaments composed of Cherry
flowers and Pine knots.’</p></blockquote>

<p>The description which Pierre Loti has given us of these fans is
so charming that we cannot refrain from quoting it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘They wave with constant motion, or carry shut, their court-fans, on the pleated
silk (?) of which are delicately painted dreamy fancies, of inexpressible charm, picturing
the reflection in the water of cloud forms, of moons wintry pale, the flight of birds,
or showers of peach blossom wafted by the wind in April mists. At each angle of
the mount is tied an enormous tassel with shades of chenille, the ends of which trail
along the ground, brushing the fine sand at each movement of the fan.’</p></blockquote>

<p>The Hi-ogi court-fans are made of the Hi wood (<i>Chamæcyparis
obtusa</i>), this being a soft light velvety wood of a beautiful golden
brown, having the additional advantage of immunity from the attacks
of wood-eating insects. The brins are twenty-five in number, fastened
with a metal rivet, and threaded through with silk strings having
very long ends, looped at the top corner of the outer ribs to form a
rosette or other floral device. These fans were first introduced with the
simple ornament of the owner’s crest; afterwards they were painted with
great elaboration and delicacy.</p>

<p>At court ceremonial the Emperor and nobles often bear the Hi-ogi
instead of the Shaku, which is a short staff or sceptre made of wood
(yew) or ivory, generally held vertical in the right hand against the lower
part of the chest, to give the body a more dignified bearing; when the
fan is borne, it is generally carried closed, and held in the same manner
as the Shaku.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>on the outside, and ornamented with silk threads or strings in five
colours; on his sixteenth birthday the Japanese youth attains his majority
and receives a present of a fan.</p>

<p>The code regulating all the details of court ceremonial is absolute,
and always observed; the use of ivory for the Shaku is confined to the
highest ranks, or the most important ceremonial; no noble could use
an ivory Shaku on any occasion. The various usages connected with the
fan are subjected to similar restrictions.</p>

<p>Ladies carried in place of the Shaku the Hi-ogi.</p>

<p>A fan of special make and design is used by the Empress, and its
use is forbidden to any subject. The blades are twenty-three in number,
connected with a white silk ribbon. The decoration is confined to the
chrysanthemum, pine, orange blossom, plum, or Camellia Japonica. The
ribbon rosettes or loops, affixed to the top of the outer blades, are arranged
in keeping with the particular flower which is represented on the fan;
these have seven long streamers, four feet long, of different colours. The
rivet also is of a particular kind—<i>paper string</i>.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>Chūkei are fans borne by priests and nobles; these have a redivergence
at the ends, and date from the period of the introduction of
the folding-fan; they are often painted with the most consummate skill,
reflecting the best traditions of Japanese art. Many of these paintings
exist; in most cases the leaves have been removed from the sticks and
mounted as pictures.</p>

<p>Fabulous stories are extant recounting the marvellous accomplishment
of the painters of the earlier epochs; amongst these is an account
of Tadahira, who is said to have painted upon a fan a cuckoo which
uttered its characteristic note whenever the fan was opened, and of
Tsunenori, who drew a lion so life-like that other beasts fled
from it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">Pg 66</a></span></p>
<p>The leading schools of Japanese painting are the Buddhist, Yamato-Tosa.
Chinese, Sesshiu Kano, Matahei (popular), Korin, Shijō (naturalistic),
and Ukiyo; each of these has well-marked characteristics preserved
even to the present day.</p>

<p>The art of Japan was to a great extent founded upon, and is in
certain directions a development of, that of the older civilisation of China.
The earliest artist, therefore, recorded in Japanese annals, is a Chinese,
Nanriu by name, of royal descent, who came to Japan about the end of
the fifth century; but of this master, and of his immediate successors, there
are no known examples.</p>

<p>It was in the succeeding century, upon the introduction of Buddhism
into Japan, that we find the first establishment of a school of Japanese
art, initiated by the Chinese and Coreans, and dedicated to the mural
decoration of Buddhistic temples.</p>

<p>From the sixth to the ninth centuries, the history of Japanese painting
is more or less clouded in doubt, and the first great artist who emerges
from the general obscurity is Kanaoka (ninth century), although the few
examples extant which are attributed to this painter are doubted by the
best experts.</p>

<p>The Yamato-Tosa school, though the direct outcome of the study
of Chinese methods, was essentially Japanese and naturalistic in character,
and was founded by Kasuga Motomitsu in the latter part of the tenth
century.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century Tsunetaka, son of Kasuga Mitsunaga,
assumed the name of Tosa and gave to the Yamato school the name it
has since retained.</p>

<p>An important movement set in at the beginning of the fifteenth
century, no less than a Chinese renaissance. For centuries Chinese
influence had been waning, and the national style of Yamato and Tosa had
held the field.</p>

<p>Sesshiu, the remarkable painter who founded the school bearing his
name, was of the noble family of Ota, and was born in 1440. At the
age of twelve or thirteen he was intended for the Church and placed
under the instruction of the abbot of the temple of Hōfukuji. Sesshiu’s
sympathies, however, were all in the direction of the fine arts, he neglected
religious training, and a story is told of him—one of those extraordinary
legends familiar in Chinese and Japanese annals—that upon one occasion,
when bound to a pillar as punishment for some misconduct, he beguiled
the weary hours of waiting by drawing rats upon the floor, using his
toes for pencil and his tears for ink (!), the representation being so life-like
as to alarm his janitor. Some versions of the story affirm that, upon the
approach of the priest, the rats scampered away.</p>

<p>At the age of forty he visited China, the fountain-head, but was
surprised to find that he had more to teach than to learn.</p>

<p>The fan of Hotei and the children, probably by Kanō Shō-yei, 1591,
may be accepted as one of the finest examples of a painted fan of the Kanō
school, the last of the three branches of the fifteenth-century revival of
Chinese teaching. The school was founded by Masanobu, a painter of
landscape, born <i>c.</i> 1423 and died 1520, its actual head, however, being
Motonobu, his son, born 1476.</p>

<p>Hotei (Master Linen-sack), the god of prosperity, was a Chinese
priest of the tenth century, famous for his fatness and his love of children.
He could sleep in the snow, never washed himself, and had the power of
infallibly predicting future events. The legends attached to his name are
very similar to those narrated of many Taoist Rishis, but his claim to
a position as Divinity appears to be due to the view enunciated in the
<i>Butsu-Zō dzu-i</i> and other works, that he was an incarnation of Miroku
Bosatsu Mâitrêya, the Messiah of the Buddhists, in which capacity his
image has long been worshipped in Chinese temples. He is usually
represented with a fan of the pear-shaped gourd type, and carries a cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">Pg 68</a></span>
bag as a trap for little boys and girls, who are enticed inside to see the
wonderful things it is supposed to contain, and then imprisoned until
they can beg their way out. These ‘Precious Things’ include the Lucky
Rain Coat, the Sacred Key, the Inexhaustible Purse, etc.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>Innumerable pictures of Hotei by Japanese artists are in existence,
some dating from the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The charmingly poetic view of the Tamagawa River, with the tea-plant
in blossom, and flying cuckoo (Hoto-Togisu), is probably by Kanō San
Raku, 1633. Both these fans are accompanied by a Japanese certificate
of authenticity.</p>

<p>Autograph, motto, and inscription fans are referred to in another part of
this work.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> The practice of inscribing sacred texts upon fans, obtained
during the latter part of the eleventh and beginning of the twelfth century,
the period ‘when the Buddhist religion was openly professed by the
wealthy and warmly supported by the luxurious.’ Fragments of Buddhist
sûtras written on fans and fan leaves exist at the temples at Yamato, Ôsaka,
the Imperial Museum Tôkyô, and elsewhere. These are copied from the
‘Lotus of the True Law,’ or other Mahâyâna texts of a like nature. The
fans, though differing somewhat in size, are all alike in paper, pigments, and
style of painting, and evidently had a common origin; they are overlaid
with gold-leaf and dusted with fine sand; upon this a thin wash of red
or black pigment is applied. The sacred text is written in ink, over a
painting, usually a figure-subject and bearing no reference to the text;
the faces sketched in a curious convention known as Hikimé Kagihana
(eye with a line, the nose with a key), in which the eye is represented
by a straight line and the nose with a somewhat acute angle. This
convention has been traced to Kasuga Takayoshi (beginning of the
twelfth century), who painted a number of picture rolls illustrating the
tales of the Genii.</p>

<p>A fan leaf owned by the Temple of Saikyôji, Sakamoto, Omi, is
illustrated in <i>Selected Relics of Japanese Art</i>, S. Tajima. A hi-ogi,
with figures and pine-tree, in the Shinto Temple, Itsukushima-Jinsha
Aki, is illustrated in the same work: this latter, doubtless, is a production
of the Taira era, possibly a dedication to the temple from a scion of the
Taira family, and painted by a daughter of Taira Kiyomori, the premier,
1167-1180, the writer of the ‘Lotus of the True Law.’</p>

<p>A similar combination of painting and writing obtained later, and was
practised by Kôyetsu Hon-Ami, the predecessor of Kôrin Ogata, the reputed
founder of the Korin school. This artist was a skilful writer of Chinese
ideographs, in which art he was one of the ‘Three Pens’ of his time,
being the founder of the Kôyetsu school of caligraphy.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>A fine example of Kôyetsu in the possession of Baron Ryûichi Kuki is
reproduced in Mr. Tajima’s work. This is painted on a gold ground, and
represents a rabbit in a flowered field. The fan is divided in two parts, the
writing, which is by the artist, being on the gilt portion. Kôyetsu died at
Kyoto in 1637, aged eighty-two.</p>

<p>The Ukiyoyé school included most of the makers of colour prints;
two of the more famous of them, Masanobu Kiato, and Hokusai Katsushika,
born in the same year, 1760, also painted fans. The former opened a shop
at Ginza for the sale of smokers’ implements and medicine, and sold besides
folding-fans and long panels upon which poems were written; both of these
he ornamented with sketches; they became renowned far and wide, and
from their sale he derived large profit.</p>

<p>A fan leaf by Hokusai, a masterly sketch of the head and shoulders of
a ‘Beauty,’ is illustrated in Tajima’s work, as also several fans painted
with courtesans, by an almost equally celebrated maker of colour prints,
Kunisada.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">Pg 70</a></span></p>
<p>Battle- or war-fans are of two kinds—the flat, rigid screen (uchiwa)
which is the earliest, and the folding (ogi). In both, iron is the material of
which it is mainly composed. The first named is sometimes formed completely

officers both for direction, offence and defence, <i>i.e.</i> as baton, weapon,

<p>This sometimes assumes a circular form, and is occasionally inlaid with

Mr. W. Harding Smith, the handle is of lacquered wood, the ornaments
at its extremities, together with the rim of the fan blade, of bronze gilt; it

<p>The fan in the possession of Mr. W. L. Behrens is ornamented with
two dragons in low relief, the motto ‘Tenka tai hei’ (international peace).</p>

<p>In the folding battle-fan, the stick is of wrought iron, the branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">Pg 71</a></span>
varying from ten to fourteen in number; in many military fans, the
stick is of bamboo, painted black, the guards of iron, often arrow-shaped,
and richly inlaid with silver.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>The decoration of the mount, of thick paper, consists of the sun, moon,
or north star, usually in red, but also in gold, on a black or coloured ground.
An unusual example, illustrated, has a gold sun on the one side, and a
silver crescent moon and nine golden planets on the reverse; the ground
being light, the guards of yellow bronze, ‘seutoku.’</p>

<p>The fine fan in the possession of Mr. L. C. R. Messel has on the
obverse a golden sun with two flying birds, and on the reverse a silver sun
with similar birds.</p>

<p>The sun <i>motif</i> is occasionally abandoned in favour of a figure-subject.
M. Ph. Burty exhibited at Liverpool in 1877 a fan that belonged to a
commander-in-chief; the leaf, of stout buff paper covered with silk tissue, is
painted in india ink with the Seven Sages in the Forest of Bamboru.
The brins are of plain whalebone, the panaches of oxidised iron, elaborately
inlaid with scroll-work and crests in silver, the latter being of the powerful
family of Nai-To. Another fan from the same collection belonged also to
an officer of high rank. The brins are of bronze gilt, the panaches of
polished iron, shaped like slips of bamboo, and chased with lions and
flowers. On the inside of one panache is an inscription in inlaid gold,
stating that the ironwork was made by U. Da-Kane-Signe; the leaf of
glistening paper.</p>

<p>The most characteristic war-fans are, however, those having the simple
red sun, with no superfluous decoration, the initial purpose of these instruments
being that of a signal. They constantly appear in representations of
battle-scenes, the general on his war-horse in the heat of battle brandishing
in his right hand the fan, the symbol of his authority and command. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">Pg 72</a></span>Hokusai’s painting of ‘Tamétomo and the Demons’ (British Museum, No.
1747), the hero is grasping a huge bow in his right hand, and waving the
folding battle-fan in his left.</p>

<p>In a print by Kuniyoshi (<i>c.</i> 1820) of the battle of Kawanakajima
between Uyesugi Kenshin and Takeda Shingen (fifteenth century), a sword-cut
is parried by the war-fan.</p>

<p>In a representation of the same battle by Yoshitora, a dismounted
general is directing with a war-fan an attack by spearmen.</p>

<p>In the colour print by Hiroshige II. of Yoshitsune and Benkei, the war-fan
also appears.</p>

<p>In the print by Shunsui of Atsumori and Kumagai, the hero, mounted,
is plunging into the sea followed closely by his adversary Kumagai, also
mounted, brandishing the war-fan as a signal and challenge.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> Two of the
many stories or legends relating to the war-fan may be given.—The first
refers to Nasu no Yoichi, an archer, whose clan took the fan as their crest,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
in allusion to his performance at the battle of Yashima in 1185. ‘When
the Taira were driven from Kyoto by the Minamoto in 1182, the Empress
Ni no Ama flew with the child-emperor Antoku, to the shrine of Itsukumisha,
where thirty pink fans, bearing the design of the sun disc (Hi no Maru)
were kept. The head-priest gave one to Antoku, saying that it contained in
the red disc the Kami of the dead Emperor Takakura (1169-1180), and would
cause arrows to recoil upon the enemy. The fan was accordingly attached
to a mast of the Taira ship, on which a court lady is always depicted, and a
challenge sent to Minamoto no Yoshitsuné, which was accepted by one of
his archers, Nasu no Yoichi, who on horseback rode in the waves, and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">Pg 73</a></span>a well-directed arrow broke the rivet which held the leaves together, and thus
shattered the fan.’</p>

<p>The second tells of Araki, a Samurai whom Oda Nobunaga wished to
kill, summoning him to audience, placing himself in such a position that the
neck of the Samurai came in line with the sliding panels separating the
audience chamber from the daimio’s room, intending to have the <i>shoji</i>
slammed together as the man knelt, and thus decapitate him. Araki, suspecting
the trap, promptly laid his iron fan in the groove, jamming the
shutters, and thus saving himself.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>The Ha uchiwa (jin sen) is a camp-fan originally introduced from
China in the seventh century and made of the feathers of the eagle, pheasant,
or peacock, the handle usually lacquered red, black, or blue; the interesting
example illustrated is formed of eagles’ feathers fixed in a horn handle.</p>

<p>Dancing-fans (Mai ogi) were introduced at the beginning of the seventeenth
century. The brins are ten in number, the mount of thick paper,
usually bearing a family crest. One of the earliest of these fans is to be
seen in the painting of a dancer by Matabei (born 1578), in the Morrison
collection (reproduced in <i>Painting in the Far East</i>, Laurence Binyon), the
decoration of the mount consisting of a few scattered leaves.</p>

<p>The fan is the most usual accompaniment of the dance, and is
generally seen in the hands of the Kagura dancers or of the performers with
the Shishi mask. The fan dance, which is more nearly allied to jugglery
than to the dance, is said to commemorate the performance of Uzume while
alluring the Sun Goddess Amaterasu from the cavern, whither she once
retired, plunging the world into temporary darkness by her absence. In
this, the fan represents the leaves of the pine-tree, the performer balancing a
number on his forehead, nose, mouth, hands and feet.</p>

<p>Tea-fans (Rikiu ogi) are for use at the tea ceremonies celebrated in
honour of tea in every province on the first day of the first month, and com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">Pg 74</a></span>memorating
the curing of the Emperor Murakami, 947-967 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, of a disease
against which the physicians were powerless. The Emperor recovered after
drinking an offering of tea made to the Goddess Kwanyin. The code, that
formerly was of a gorgeous description, was modified later by Sen-no Rikiu,
from whom the fan set apart as cake tray or saucer derives its name. The
Rikiu fan is of the simplest possible construction, having only three sticks,
the decoration also being of a simple character. It is used for handing
round little cakes, and for no other purpose, fanning being strictly tabooed
during such a dignified proceeding.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>The giant closing fans (Mita ogi) were used in the processions at Ise in
honour of the Sun Goddess, the traditional originator of the Japanese
dynasty. These were six or seven feet long, five men being appointed to
carry one of this huge magnitude.</p>

<p>Water-fans (Mizu uchiwa), for kitchen use, date from the eighteenth
century. These are of bamboo split into segments, covered with stout
paper, and varnished or lightly lacquered so as to allow of the fan being
dipped in water, thus securing extra coolness by evaporation. They are
often decorated with figures and other subjects, the varnish subsequently
applied being of a rich warm brown.</p>

<p>Roll-up fans (Maki uchiwa) are circular, the paper stiffened with
thin strips of bamboo; the handle is of bamboo cut through with a slit
to allow the circular fan, which is set on a pivot, to have free play.
When open, the strips of the bamboo foundation are horizontal, thus
securing rigidity; when not in use, the position of the strips may be
reversed, and the disc rolled round the stick and tied.</p>

<p>Of modern fans, those of ivory and tortoise-shell, carved or decorated
with lacquer and inlay, are, for the most part, made for exportation, and
are often of extreme beauty. The excellent example in the Victoria and
Albert Museum is decorated with circular medallions in gold lacquer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">Pg 75</a></span>various shades, portions being carved in relief. It is finely inlaid in
places with mother of pearl; signed by Taishin (a pupil of Zesshin), and
dated 1884. An example, equally fine, is given from the collection of
Mr. M. Tomkinson. This is decorated with a view of Fuji san, or
Fuji-no-yama (peerless mountain); those born within its watch are considered
most happy and fortunate beings.</p>

<p>Of the cheaper hand-screens exported in large quantities to Europe,
the simplest form is that of a dried palm leaf cut to the required shape,
and bound round the edge, the stem forming the handle. The most
common variety is made by splitting bamboo into thin strips that are
spread out radially, fastened with thin cord, and covered with paper; these
are decorated with designs displaying high qualities of arrangement
and graphic skill, and are printed in that process of chromoxylography
which, if not actually invented by the Japanese, has been carried by them
to its highest point of excellence. A more elaborate hand-screen is also
exported, the covering of silk, painted.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood, that the fan, entering as it does so
closely into the daily life of the Japanese, should also form the subject
of many games. Two characteristic instances may be cited. The ‘fan
and cup’ game was particularly favoured by court nobles and ladies.
A company met by the river, each member launching on the water a fan
prepared with varnish or lacquer to ensure buoyancy and to prevent
absorption of moisture. The game consisted in the composition of a
verse or couplet of poetry during the time the fans were at the mercy
of wind and wave, and before they regained terra-firma. Tea-cups were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">Pg 76</a></span>also used, this last being illustrated in a Chinese makimono by Hwei-chi
Ku-Yuen, British Museum, 276.</p>

<p>In the ogi otoshi or fan target game, a target called ‘cho,’ made somewhat
in the form of a butterfly, is placed on a low table or pedestal on the
floor. A fan is thrown from a given distance with a sudden and peculiar
turn of the wrist, causing it to reverse itself in its passage through the
air and strike the target with the rivet end. This game is played by
two people facing the target at opposite ends. Bells are attached to the
outer edge of the ‘cho,’ that sound when a successful hit has been
accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>No notice, however brief, of the fans of Japan would be complete
without some reference to the constant employment of the fan form as a
decorative <i>motif</i> in Japanese design, one of the many evidences of the
important place the fan holds in the affections of the people. Lacquered
tea-trays assume the shape of the fan; inkstands take the form of a
closed fan, the ink-well at the rivet end, the body of the fan forming a
case for pens;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> while in diapered patterns, borders, and other decoration,
both flat and in relief, the fan motif is constantly made use of. The
interesting series of fan-shaped panels illustrative of Japanese history, by
an unknown artist of the Yamato Tosa school, seventeenth century,
British Museum, 305-324, are excellent instances of the use of the fan
form in flat decoration, these being probably removed from an old screen.
Three kakémonos in the collection of Mr. R. Phené Spiers are each finely
painted with four full-sized fans, decorated with various lilies, drawn with
that consummate skill and knowledge of plant form which would appear
to be the peculiar heritage of the sons of Dai Nippon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>FANS OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLES</h3>

<p><span class="figleft100" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/i_157.jpg" width="100" height="235" alt="" />
</span>
IN any survey of the industrial arts of the more primitive
nations or peoples, three facts must be taken
into consideration: 1st, climatic conditions; 2nd, the
natural products indigenous to the country, and the
outcome of its climatic conditions; 3rd, the degree of
the intellectual development of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>The study of any particular branch of art presupposes
some acquaintance with the history of the
people among whom the art was practised. In considering,
however, the art of primitive peoples, this
matter of history and association plays but a minor
part. Pictorial storiation is practically non-existent, individualism is lost
in the collective racial influence. Moreover, the raw material of industry
is precisely the kind readiest to hand, and generally demanding the
minimum of skill in its working.</p>

<p>The fans of primitive or more or less uncivilised peoples may therefore
be divided into three or four distinct types: 1st, the natural palm-leaf
fans, common in most palm-producing countries; 2nd, the plaited rush-,
grass-, or cane-fans, these being generally of the spatula, or half-halberd
shape; 3rd, hide-fans, which usually take the form of round or oval
screens; 4th, feather-fans, the character being necessarily determined
by the kind of feathers employed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">Pg 78</a></span></p>

<p>It will readily be perceived that the earliest and simplest forms are
those supplied ready to hand by Nature herself, viz. palm-leaf fans.
These may be divided into two great classes. In the one, the leaf is set
symmetrically on the stem; in the other, it is fixed laterally; in both instances
the natural stem forms the handle. An excellent example of the first
named is the large fan made from the leaf of the <i>Pritchardia pacifica</i>,
used only by the great chiefs of the Fiji Islands. In this the leaf is cut to
the shape of a reversed heart, bound round the border by a wisp, the
ends of the fronds being arranged in tufts at intervals round the edge
of the fan, forming an agreeable contrast to the simple radiating lines
of the leaf.</p>

<p>In the second class of palm-fan, one side of the leaf is either cut
away or bent laterally, the large leaves of the Palmyra or Talipot palms
being used, cut short, the edges worked round with an applied border
of thin strips of the leaf. This form appears to be ubiquitous;
it is common, not only to primitive peoples, but also to the more
civilised countries of the East. In India it appears both in the
form of the smaller hand-fans and the larger pankhás, often richly
decorated in colour, with inserted plaques of mica, or other ornamental
device.</p>

<p>The art of plaiting with rush, straw, grass, cane, roots, and other
flexible materials is one of the very earliest practised by man; we find it in
constant use amongst savage tribes, who employ the process for mats,
baskets, various coverings for the person, and other articles of personal and
domestic use;  both the technical skill and the æsthetic effect being often of
a very high order. It will at once be perceived that this process is especially
suited to the fan, which demands, above all things, lightness of construction;
the plaited fan is therefore the most usual form in that vast group of
islands known as Polynesia, as well as in most other countries situated
within the equatorial belt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">Pg 79</a></span></p>

<p>The principle of plaiting is to commence from the stick or handle,
which generally extends two-thirds of the distance along the blade or leaf
of the fan. The stick is generally of wood, occasionally of ivory, and in
some instances both substances are employed, the handle often elaborately
carved.</p>

<p>The most usual shape is that of a spear cut crosswise and shortened:
the ordinary principle of form-development is followed, from extreme
attenuation lengthwise, to extreme width and shortness, the form of the
lower border varying from an acute angle to a semicircle, the top varying
from straight line to arched or curved.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_159.jpg" width="400" height="130" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The plaiting is of varying degrees of fineness according to the
character of the leaf, straw, cane, or fibre employed. The patterning also
varies, occasionally straw of a different colour (black or brown) being
introduced.</p>

<p>This type of fan is found in the Marquesas Islands (South Pacific),
the Hervey (Cook) Islands, Solomon Islands, Samoa, and the Hawaiian or
Sandwich Islands. A large plaited broad rush-fan appears in the Horniman
Museum, made and presented by Queen Kapiolani of the Hawaiian
Islands (illustrated p. 272); a similarly formed fan appears in the same
collection from Tahiti.</p>

<p>In some examples from Samoa in the British Museum collection, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">Pg 80</a></span>
shapes are slightly more varied, remarkably so in one instance in which the
top border assumes a pointed or zigzag pattern. The kite shape also
is found in various forms. (Page 81, Nos. 1, 2, 3.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_160.jpg" width="400" height="105" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HAWAIIAN ISLANDS</p></div>

<p>In the Hawaiian group a spatula shape appears, this also being
developed to its utmost limit of breadth or width, the handles of plaited
hair, in two colours, forming a pattern.</p>

<p>In British Guiana a curious fan (warri warri) is used, formed of strips
of the Ita palm, having no stem, but simply a rolled edge, either single
or double (crosswise), forming a finish to the leaf or blade, and affording
a grip for the hand. The size of these fans varies from six to fifteen inches.
A development of the above form is used as bellows by the natives of
Ecuador and Peru; the double handle slightly longer, the forms varied
to leaf and shield shape. In India, also, the two-handled bellows-fan
is used, made of strips of the leaf-stalk of the Tucuma palm.</p>

<p>In the British Museum is a curious little fan having only a loop
for handle, formed of plaited reed (Iturite) of two colours, brown and
black. (Page 81, No. 8.)</p>

<p>In the hide-fans common on the western border of Africa, the
form approaches that of a circular screen, set on a wooden handle. In
these the ornamentation is either formed of the natural markings of the
hide, or an ‘applique’ of leather, painted white, and cut to various
perforated patterns, so as to show a bright vermilion feather stuff in the
perforations; the three colours, the brown or black of the hide, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a><br /><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">Pg 82</a></span>white leather, and the vermilion perforations forming a very effective contrast.
Examples from Nigeria appear in the British Museum collection.
A smaller fan of goatskin is in the Horniman Museum. These hide-fans
form part of the fantastic death-dance costumes of Old Calabar.</p>

<p>Feathers, although constantly employed as ornaments to the person,
are less commonly used for fans than might generally be supposed,
especially in countries where bird life is abundant.</p>

<p>Amongst the Blackfoot nation of North American Indians, eagles’
feathers were used as a standard of valour at the advent of the white
man, and the capture of eagles was regarded as a sacred ceremony. In the
British Museum is a fan of these eagles’ feathers, with a handle covered
with coarse linen of a printed pattern; to the tip of each feather is affixed
a small pink fluffy feather, thus forming a pink border to the top of the
fan, the border being repeated at the top of the handle. This was procured
from ‘Little Ears,’ a Blood Indian. A similar fan, minus the
handle, appears in the same collection; in this instance the tips of the
feathers are ornamented with little tails made of hair, varied at the lower
ends by white fur. In consequence of a dream that appeared to a
Blood chief named Bears’ Lodge, a dance was instituted in which these
fans were waved, and whistles made of eagles’ bones were carried and
used. (Illustrated opposite.)</p>

<p>Ceremonial fans were employed by the Indians of the Great West;
we have an account of the visit of a Taensas chief on the banks of the
Lower Mississippi to Le Sieur de La Salle in 1682: ‘The Chief condescended
to visit La Salle at his camp; a favour which he would by no
means have granted, had the visitors been Indians. A master of ceremonies
and six attendants preceded him, to clear the path and prepare
the place of meeting. When all was ready, he was seen advancing
clothed in a white robe, and preceded by two men bearing <i>white fans</i>,
while a third displayed a disc of burnished copper, doubtless to represent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">Pg 83</a></span>the Sun, his ancestor, or, as others will have it, his elder brother.’<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> It is
safe to assume that these fans were of feathers, and the incident is an
evidence that the use of the fan in high ceremonial was universal, and
common to both East and West.</p>

<p>There still remains the cockade form of fan, found amongst
the West African tribes; an example appearing in the British Museum
collection, of paper, with primitive painted ornaments in black, red, and
yellow, alternated with inscription; the fan measuring some twenty
inches in diameter.</p>

<p>A most interesting example of hide appears in the Horniman Museum,
taken from the king’s palace at Benin in 1897. This, doubtless, from
its size and the cumbrous nature of its material, as well as the foregoing
example, was waved by the attendants of some
highly placed personage, probably the king.</p>

<p><span class="figright125" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="125" height="266" alt="" /></span>
The square or oblong flag-fan is made by
the natives of the Niger settlements of West
Africa. An example in the Victoria and Albert
Museum is of plaited grass with strips of the
natural shades of brown and yellow, and others
stained red and black; the handle is covered
with reddish-brown leather, fringed along the side
of the leaf, the fan edged with the same material.</p>

<p>The appearance of similar decorative <i>motifs</i>
in countries widely separate opens up an interesting
field of speculation. Some explanation,
however, of the fact of the cockade (though in
itself, together with the flag form, a simple device)
appearing among the West African tribes, may
be found in the fact that the natives of the interior of West Africa were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">Pg 84</a></span>long exposed to the influence of the Mohammedan culture of the Western
Sudan; the races were to some extent intermingled, and a close commercial
relationship has been maintained during a long period.</p>

<p>Fly-whisks are obviously articles of necessity throughout the
countries of the Torrid Zone.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> These are formed either of feathers, of
vegetable fibre, of the hair of the larger animals, of hempen string, or
other materials.</p>

<p>These instruments occasionally acquire a sacred significance; Blondel
affirms that they were common in Peru and Mexico before the Spanish
conquest, and, together with the fan, were used also as a symbol of
authority, the handles being adorned with the precious stone ‘theoatz-ehuaquetzalli.’</p>

<p>A species of fly-whisk, formed of dried grass, is used as a war
fetish by the natives of the Gold Coast; in some instances an iron
bell is attached, carried and rung by the magician in front of the
warriors. Sticks and also fan handles bound with feathers are used as
propitiatory offerings to the gods by the natives of the South-Eastern
Pacific. (Page 81, Nos. 9, 10.)</p>

<p>In the Hawaiian Islands feather wands (Kahili) are carried as a symbol
of rank; these appear to have been originally fly-whisks, and are formed of
the tail feathers of various birds. Six examples are included in the
British Museum collection, the handles formed of ivory alternated with
horn, the extremity of the handle being formed of the bone of an
enemy.</p>

<p>A long fly-whisk from Hawaii appears in the same collection, formed
of the neck feathers of the cock, of varying colours, white, orange, and
brown, with black tip; the handle of wood, bound round with black and
buff cane.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">Pg 85</a></span></p>
<p>The most primitive form of fly-whisk is that from the Andaman
Islands in the Bay of Bengal, made of grass fibre, bound to a
stick, and resembling a rough besom.</p>

<p><span class="figright50" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/i_167a.jpg" width="50" height="237" alt="" /></span>
Vegetable fibre of various kinds would appear, indeed,
to be the material most commonly employed for these articles,
being, doubtless, the readiest substance to hand. A remarkable
series of fly-whisks from Tahiti, formed of fibre, were
presented to the British Museum by Sir W. C. Trevelyan,
Bart.; in these, the handles (of wood) are finely plaited halfway
with fibre of two colours, the rest of the handle of a spiral
form, the head carved to a fantastic shape.</p>

<p>An interesting fly-whisk from the Tonga Islands is formed
of cocoa-nut fibre, finely plaited at its junction with the
wooden handle; small turquoise, black, and white beads, are
<span class="figleft75" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/i_167b.jpg" width="75" height="269" alt="" /></span>
affixed to the plaited portion, these forming an
extremely effective contrast to the rich red brown
of the fibre. In Samoa, enormous fly-whisks are formed
of this material, sometimes affixed to a handle of wood, and
occasionally bound round with the same material to form
the handle. (Page 81, Nos. 11, 12.)</p>

<p>A curious fly-whisk from Tahiti is of twisted fibre, the
handle being formed of two birds’ wing-bones bound
together, with a portion of plaited fibre in two colours forming
the extremity of the stem at its junction with the
whisk.</p>

<p>The Matabeles employ fly-whisks of horse-hair, both
white and black. An example of white horse-hair bound
with brass, fixed in a handle of cane, and also one of black
hair, with the handle formed of plaited brass wire, are to
be seen in the British Museum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">Pg 86</a></span></p>

<p>A similar fly-whisk of black horse-hair is in the same collection; the
handle of steel wire, bound round a double
leather thong, the extremity forming a loop
<span class="figleft100" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/i_168a.jpg" width="100" height="279" alt="" /></span>
<span class="figright75" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/i_168b.jpg" width="75" height="334" alt="" /></span>
ornamented by blue glass beads. These are
used by the elders (Elmoru) of the East
African Protectorate.</p>

<p>Black horse-hair forms the material of
fly-whisks used by the natives of the Upper
Nile. In the example illustrated the hair
is set in an open-shaped piece of leather,
with a long bone handle.</p>

<p>In Abyssinia, also, fly-whisks formed
of the tails of the smaller animals are
employed. An example occurs in the India
Museum, the hair dyed red and yellow, the
handle of silver parcel-gilt.</p>

<p>Probably the most curious of all fans and fan-like objects in use
among primitive peoples is the so-called Ghost Fan of South Celebes
(Malay Archipelago). This mysterious object consists of a triangular
arrangement at the end of a stick, of fine spun red stuff embellished with
a bordering of gold tinsel, together with spangles or hanging ornaments
along its lower edge. Around the stick is tightly twisted a piece of paper,
probably containing an incantation. An example occurs in the Ethnological
Museum, Berlin, referred to and illustrated in <i>Der Fächer</i>, Georg Buss.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE FLABELLUM AND EARLY FEATHER-FAN</h3>

<p><span class="figleft100" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/i_171.jpg" width="100" height="257" alt="" />
<span class="caption">ANGEL WAVING A
FLABELLUM<br />(From the Book of Kells.)</span></span>
THE Christian Church was quick to perceive the utility
of the fan as an instrument of religious ceremonial,
imparting to this object a mysterious importance, a
sacerdotal distinction, preserving and shielding it
from common use; it has even been claimed that
this appropriation was instituted by the Apostles
themselves, Bishop Suarez attempting to substantiate
this by an appeal to an apocryphal liturgy attributed
to St. James.</p>

<p>The earliest recognised notice, however, of the
flabellum as a liturgical ornament is in the Apostolical
Constitutions, which direct that after the oblation,
before and during the prayer of consecration, two
deacons are to stand, one on either side of the altar,
holding a fan made of thin membrane (parchment), or
of peacocks’ feathers, or of fine linen, and quietly drive away the flies
and other small insects, that they may not stick against the vessels;
this use of the flabellum being derived, not from the ritual of the
synagogue of the Jews, but from that of the Pagan temples. Butler
(<i>Ancient Coptic Churches of Egypt</i>) quotes a similar rubric from the liturgy
of St. Clement. The same author refers also to flabella waved by the
deacons in the Syrian Jacobite, and probably also in the Coptic, rite for
the ordination of a priest at laying on of hands—they appeared at solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">Pg 88</a></span>
festivals and at regular celebrations of mass.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> On Good Friday, also, they
were used at the consecrations of Chrism—seven deacons holding flabella,
walking on either side of the holy oil when carried in procession.</p>

<p>Many evidences of its early adoption by the Latin Church are extant.
Moschus (<i>Prat. Spirituale</i>, § 150) cites an occurrence showing its employment
<span class="figleft125" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/i_172.jpg" width="125" height="430" alt="" />
<span class="caption">SILVER PROCESSIONAL
FLABELLUM<br />(From Butler.)</span></span>
in the time of Pope Agapetus, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 535, in which a
deacon, who had falsely accused his bishop, was removed
from the altar when he was <i>holding the fan</i>
in the presence of the Pope, because he hindered the
descent of the Holy Spirit on the gifts. This same
author (<i>Prat. Spirituale</i>, § 196), in narrating how some
shepherd boys near Apamea were imitating the
celebration of the Eucharist in childish sport, is careful
to mention that two of the children stood on either
side of the celebrant, vibrating their handkerchiefs like
fans,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> thus showing that the use of the flabellum was
general even at this early period. In a letter of
St. Hildebert, Archbishop of Tours, <i>c.</i> 1098, accompanying
the present of a flabellum made to a friend, its
use and mystic import are explained—the flies,
representing the temptations of the devil, are to be
driven away by the Catholic faith.</p>

<p>Gradually the waving of the flabellum acquired
a deeper symbolic meaning—it was held to signify
the wafting of divine influence upon the ceremony,
the movements to and fro symbolising the quivering
of the wings of the Seraphim; hence we find repre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">Pg 89</a></span>sentatives
of the Seraphim playing an important part in its ornamentation.
In the Book of Kells we have a representation of the four evangelists in
which the Seraphic symbol of St. Matthew is figured by the crossed flabella,
each having a pair of bells with triple hammers; the remaining three
evangelists being represented by the usual symbols of the Lion in the
centre, and the Bull and Eagle at the lower corners.</p>

<p>Germanus (Neale, <i>Eastern Church</i>, p. 396) goes even further, and
holds that the vibration of the flabellum typifies the tremor and astonishment
of the angels at our Lord’s Passion.</p>

<p>In a Byzantine fresco at Nekrési (Caucasus), of a date uncertain but somewhat
late, an open sanctuary is represented with two angelic winged deacons
waving seraphic flabella around the head of the second person of the Trinity.</p>

<p><span class="figright125" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/i_173.jpg" width="125" height="242" alt="" />
<span class="caption">COPTIC FLABELLUM.<br />(From Butler.)</span></span>
We have, then, in these flabella, two distinct
types—the one composed of some yielding material
such as vellum or peacocks’ feathers, the handles
usually of ivory; the other rigid, and formed of
metal, either silver or silver gilt, this latter being
essentially a processional fan; both being used in
ceremonial processions and celebrations of the
mass.</p>

<p>Metal flabella also divide themselves into two
classes—the large-handled processional fan, and
the short hand-fan; an example of the latter is
given from Butler, and consists of a circular disc
of metal decorated with two rude figures of the
Seraphim interspersed with Romanesque ornament.</p>

<p>Actual specimens of ancient flabella are almost non-existent, although
a few have been preserved on the Continent; one of the most famous
being that of the abbey church of Tournus, on the Saône, south of
Chalon, at present in the Carrand collection, Museo Nazionale, Florence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">Pg 90</a></span>
This remarkable example, which may be taken as a characteristic type, is
formed of a strip of vellum folded <i>à la cocarde</i>, painted on both sides with
figures of St. Philibert and other saints divided by conventional trees.
The outer borders consist of a continuous scroll of Romanesque ornament
interspersed with figures of animals. Latin hexameters and pentameters
are inscribed on the three concentric borders of the fan, as follows:—</p>

<p>The handle is formed of four cylinders of white bone, two being
ornamented with semi-naturalistic vine foliage running spirally round the
stem, the two lower fluted. These cylinders are united by nodes or
pommels, tinted green; on the middle node the inscription <span class="smcap lowercase">MICHEL · M ·</span>,
on the upper <big>✠</big> <span class="smcap lowercase">IOHEL ME SCAE FECIT IN HONORE MARIAE</span>. The stem is
surmounted by a capital with four figures of saints, whose names appear
on the node immediately beneath: <span class="smcap lowercase">S · MARIA · S · AGN · S · FILIB · S · PET</span>.
On the capital rests the guard or box which receives the flabellum when
closed; the four sides are of elaborately carved white bone with green-tinted
borders; the front and back panels, betraying evidence of a different hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">Pg 91</a></span>are now in the Musée de Cluny, Paris, and consist of arabesques of foliage
with figures, birds, animals, etc., modelled with great spirit. The two lateral
panels or faces form the richest portion of the fan, and are carved with six
subjects from the <i>Eclogues</i> of Virgil. Three seated senators with other
figures, two shepherds with oxen; three shepherds, two of whom are playing
pipes, some sheep in the foreground; a seated shepherd blowing a horn;
another shepherd with oxen and goats; a shepherd and satyr with dog and
goats; and a seated shepherd with two oxen.</p>

<p>The modelling is somewhat rude and archaic, but extremely rich in
decorative effect. One edge of the fan is fixed in the box, the other is
attached to one of the lateral panels, which, in order to open the fan, is
drawn over and attached to the reversed side by means of a cord.</p>

<p>Both sides are figured in colours in Du Sommerard’s work <i>Les Arts
du Moyen Age</i>.</p>

<p>Of other flabella which exist, one is preserved in the Dominican
Monastery of Prouille, in the diocese of Toulouse; another, with a handle
of silver, was formerly at St. Victor, near Marseilles.</p>

<p>In the British Museum is a portion of an ivory handle of a flabellum,
French, of the twelfth century, about twelve inches in length, finely carved
with figures of the twelve Apostles and emblems of the Evangelists. In the
Victoria and Albert Museum is a similar fragment, but smaller, carved with
compartments of animals, mythical beasts, monsters, etc.; these probably
formed the two divisions of one single flabellum. These handles were
sometimes square-shaped, as in the instance of the fragment in the Salting
collection at present in the Victoria and Albert Museum. This is also
French, of the fourteenth century, and is carved on each of its sides with
figures of saints in niches, with crocketed arches.</p>

<p>A portion of the cylindrical stem of a flabellum or aspergillum,
probably French of the twelfth century, is in the British Museum. This
represents the occupations of the twelve months of the year in three bands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">Pg 92</a></span>
as follows: January, a two-headed Janus looking in opposite directions;
February, a figure seated before a fire; March, cutting trees with a hatchet;
April, gathering blossoms; May, an equestrian figure with hawk; June, a
mower with sickle and hooked stick; July, a mower with scythe; August,
a reaper with sickle; September, thrashing wheat; October, sowing corn;
November, killing a pig; December, pouring wine into a cask.</p>

<p>The figures are separated from each other by trees, and the three bands
by rings ornamented with foliage and zigzag patterns with semi-rosettes,
and at top and bottom are rings with half-defaced inscriptions.</p>

<p>There is also in the same collection a capital of morse ivory for the
handle of a flabellum, North German, twelfth century.</p>

<p>These instruments figure repeatedly in inventories of church and
abbey property. Butler quotes from one at St. Riquier, near Abbeville, in
831, ‘a silver fan for chasing flies from the sacrifice.’ At Amiens, in 1250,
there existed a fan for a similar purpose, ‘flabellum factum de serico et auro
ad repellendas muscas et immunda.’ In 1363 La Sainte Chapelle possessed
‘duo flabella vulgariter nuncupata muscalia, ornata perlis’; in 1376, ‘ij
flabella, Gallice esmouchoirs, ornata de perlis.’</p>

<p>In the sacrist rolls of Ely, ‘Item, j flabello empt. ad Aurifabrum, 7d.

<p>In England the flabellum was in use even in remote parishes. In the
churchwarden’s accounts at Walderswick, Suffolk, in 1493, is an entry of
IVd. for ‘a bessume of pekoks fethers.’</p>

<p>Although the flabellum is very rarely represented in illuminated MSS.,
in the Book of Kells we find miniatures of angels waving these instruments;
in the Gospel of Trèves (eighth century) is a conjoined evangelistic, symbolic
figure holding a small flabellum in one hand and a eucharistic lance in the
other. In a Hiberno-Saxon MS. of the eighth century a figure of St.
Matthew is seen holding in his hand a flabellum. In the public library at
Rouen are two representations of the use of this instrument; in the one, a
thirteenth-century missal, formerly belonging to the abbey of Jumièges,
the fan is held by the deacon in front of the altar at which the priest
<span class="figright200" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_183.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="" />
<span class="caption">FROM A GREEK PSALTER.<br />(British Museum.)</span></span>
officiates; in the other, it is waved over
the head of the priest as he elevates
the wafer: this in a pontifical of the
church of Rheims, thirteenth century.</p>

<p>A psalter in Greek, British Museum,
additional MSS. 19,352, gives a miniature
of an angel waving a large flabellum
over the head of David who is asleep;
another instance occurs in a thirteenth-century
Service-Book in the Barberini
Library, given by Paciandi.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>Representations in printed books
are still more rare. In Barclay’s <i>Ship of Fools of the World</i>, 1509,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">Pg 94</a></span>we find, however, a woodcut illustration of a spectacled bibliophile wearing
cap and bells, seated among his books, holding in his hand a flabellum
of feathers, saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div></div></div>

<p>the word <i>flabellis</i> being here applied to the ordinary hand-brush or duster.</p>

<p>By the end of the sixteenth century the flabellum had fallen into
complete disuse, its original purpose having been
<span class="figleft125" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/i_184.jpg" width="125" height="323" alt="" />
<span class="caption">FROM GOAR</span></span>
long abandoned or forgotten, although as late as 1688
Randle Holmes, <i>Academy of Armory</i>, refers to ‘the
flap or fann to drive away flies from the chalice.’
Its sole reminiscence in the west is in the large
flabella of peacocks’ feathers carried at solemn festivals
in procession before the Pope. In the Greek Church,
the fan is still delivered to the deacon at ordination
as the symbol of his sacred office.</p>

<p>From the period of the final break up of the Roman
Empire to that of the Crusades the general use of the
fan was discontinued in Europe, and was probably only
adopted by highly placed personages; during these early
periods, however, it was still the religious fly-flap or
flabellum, <i>d’émouchoir</i>, and Blondel infers from the
circumstance, of Étienne Boileau not referring to it in
his <i>Livre des Mestiers</i> (1200), that even at this time it
no longer served any domestic purpose except in very
rare instances.</p>

<p>The earliest English reference to the fan appears to be the following:—</p>

<p>‘In the thirtieth year of King Edward I., precept was given to Nicholas</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">Pg 95</a></span></p>
<p>Pycot, Chamberlain, of the Guildhall of London that he should cause
to be sold all pledges for any debt whatsoever then in his custody.</p>

<p>‘In an inventory of pledges sold for arrears on the King’s Tallage, 31
Edward <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, 1303. One fan (value not stated) taken from Henry Gyleberd
of the ward of Basseshawe for 2s. 8d., which he owes of arrears of the
fifteenth.’<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>The oldest existing Christian fan, and the most famous of the few
fans of which we have any record during the Middle Ages, is that which
has become identified with Theodolinda, Queen of the Lombards, the
saintly princess, who possessed a nail of the holy cross which was
ultimately used as a setting to the Iron Crown of the kings of Lombardy.
This fan is preserved as a sacred relic in the Cathedral of Monza near
Milan. Superstition has invested it with magical powers. Pilgrimages
are made to Monza by village maidens, often from a long distance, on
a certain day of the year, as the act of touching it is believed to facilitate
and promote their marriage projects. It is of the cockade shape,
formed of vellum, of the beautiful purple hue we find in contemporary
manuscripts; it is decorated with an alternating diaper of Romanesque
ornament in gold and silver, and round its outer border on either side is
the following inscription in Latin hexameters, which is given by Mr. W.
Burges, <i>Archæological Journal</i>, vol. xiv., on the one side:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><big>✠</big>&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Ut sis conspectu praeclara et cara venusta,</div>
<div class="line i2">Hac rogo defendens solem requiesce sub umbra,</div>
<div class="line i2">Has soror obtutu depictas arte figuras</div>
<div class="line i2">Praelegeris flavido ut decoreris casta colore.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and on the reverse, now much obliterated:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Pulchrior ut facie dulcis videaris amica</div>
<div class="line i6">... fervores solis ...</div>
<div class="line">Me retinere manu Ulfeda (?) poscente memento</div>
<div class="line i6">... splendoris ...’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">Pg 96</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Burges has pointed out that the form of the letters of the inscription,
which are Roman with slight Rustic variations, as also the purple dye,
are sufficiently similar to contemporary manuscripts of St. Augustine of
the end of the sixth century.</p>

<p>The case which accompanies the fan is constructed on the same
principle as the handle of the Tournus flabellum, although less elongated.
It is of wood, covered with silver, the wooden part probably modern, made
to the original shape, with the old silver used again. The length of the
case with handle is 15-1/2 inches, the diameter of the leaf 10 inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">Pg 97</a></span></p>

<p>The side flap was originally fastened to the fan, and drawn round
until it formed a complete circle, as in the instance of the Tournus
flabellum.</p>

<p>With respect to the identity of the original owner of this fan, although
the claim which has been made for its association with Queen
Theodolinda cannot be substantiated, its identification with any well-defined
personage is equally difficult. Who was Ulfeda? Mr. Burges
states with reference to this name that it is by no means the most legible
part of the inscription—that he has been able to discover no one so
named who lived during this period.</p>

<p>M. de Linas points out that the name Ulféda is a variant of the Saxon
Elpheid, which the marvellous cloisonné fibula, exhumed, as is said, from
a Carlovingian sepulchre at Wittislingen (Bavaria), gives under the softened
form of Ufeila.</p>

<p>This Monza fan is not mentioned in an inventory of the treasury in
1275; in that of 1353 the following, however, occurs:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Item, fabella, seu orata una argenti facta ad modum unius maze cum manica
ligni ligata in argento.’</p></blockquote>

<p>M. de Linas infers from the fact of the extremity of the handles being
provided with a ring, that it was <i>not</i> a liturgic fan, and certainly this
circumstance, together with the smallness of its size, would appear to be
a sufficient evidence of its secular use; in any event, and whatever its
original use, this fan, together with that of Tournus, must be accounted
among the most precious relics preserved to us from that dim and dark,
but extremely fascinating period.</p>

<p>The rigid flag-fan, which appears to have been in intermittent use
in Europe from the early centuries of our era, consists of an oblong
parallelogram with a handle fitted to one of its longer sides. These were
made either of plaited straw of various colours, of linen painted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">Pg 98</a></span>
embroidered, of parchment or vellum, or of silk, woven or embroidered,
often with lozenge-shaped diapering.</p>

<p>The earliest examples remaining to us are Coptic or Saracenic. M.
Robert Forrer in his <i>Reallexikon</i> figures two which were obtained from
the cemetery of Akhmîn, the Greek Panopolis, presumably belonging to the
fourth-sixth century. Of these, one is finely plaited of brown, red, and
black straw, with a representation of four hearts encircling a cross, the
other of a reticulated diapered pattern with a border of linen. A similar
flag-fan of plaited straw appears in the Berlin Museum: this example, also,
is probably Coptic.</p>

<p>M. Charles de Linas, quoting from the life of St. Fulgentius, sixth
century, affirms that the Bishop of Ruspa, whilst he was a monk and even
<span class="figleft75" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/i_190.jpg" width="75" height="244" alt="" /></span>
an abbot, occupied his leisure hours in copying Holy Writ
or in plaiting ‘fly-flaps’ of palm leaves. This same author<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>
figures a flag-fan from an engraved glass vase, exhumed from
the catacombs, and now preserved in the library of the Vatican,
representing the Virgin Mother seated with the infant Saviour
on her lap, a deacon behind agitating a rectangular flabellum
fixed in a lateral handle. The zigzag ornamentation indicates
that this, also, was formed of plaited straw.</p>

<p>In the Observances of the Augustinian Priory at Barnwell,
Cambridge, ‘The Fraterer ought to provide mats and rushes
to strew the Frater and the alleys of the Cloister at the Frater
door, and frequently to renew them; in summer to throw
flowers, mint, and fennel into the air to make a sweet odour, and to provide
fans.’ ‘Muscatoria in estate providere.’<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>The most remarkable example, however, of this banner form is on
a diptich of ivory offered by Charles the Bald to the abbey of Saint-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">Pg 99</a></span>Corneille
de Compiègne, and at present in the Cabinet de Médailles at
Paris. On the inferior compartment of the diptich is a eunuch (?) holding
<span class="figright125" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/i_193.jpg" width="125" height="266" alt="" />
<span class="caption">FROM AN IVORY DIPTICH.<br />(Cabinet de Médailles, Paris.)</span></span>
with both hands a flabellum apparently of metal,
the handle long, thick at the end, and engraved
with lines representing masonry; the top in the
form of a turret, from which hangs a cord. The
leaf, in all probability embroidered, has a plain
broad border enclosing a laurel wreath.</p>

<p>The banner form of fan became fashionable
with the Venetian women of the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries. These were of two kinds:
the one, of a more ornate character, was used by
matrons; the other, <i>abanico di novia</i>, of a delicate
whiteness, used only by engaged maidens or the
newly married. An example of the latter occurs
in the portrait of the painter’s daughter Lavinia,
by Titian, in the Dresden Gallery, probably
painted in 1555. Titian painted this favourite
daughter some eighteen years later; in this portrait
she carries a feather-fan, the sign of Venetian nobility, Titian having
been, in the interval, created a Count Palatine by the Emperor
Charles <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span></p>

<p>Authentic examples of these flag-fans are exceedingly rare. A richly
embroidered Venetian fan of the sixteenth century is in the collection of
the Grand Duke Frederick of Baden; another, also Italian, has a large oval
medallion with ornaments of silver and brown, and is in the collection of
Mr. G. J. Rosenberg of Karlsruhe; a third, <i>abanico di novia</i>, of white
vellum enriched with Venetian lace of the sixteenth century, is referred to by
Blondel as being in the possession of Madame Achille Jubinal of Paris.</p>

<p>These fans were probably introduced into the western countries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">Pg 100</a></span>
Europe by the returning Crusaders. They never, apparently, obtained any
great vogue except in Italy; they continued, however, in intermittent use
until the close of the sixteenth century, when, together with feather, tuft,
and cockade fans, they gradually gave place to the modern folding-fan
which had by this time made its appearance in Portugal from the Far
East.</p>

<p>From the fourteenth century onwards, the history of the fan becomes
more clear, and Blondel quotes a number of French inventories in which the
fan figures—that of the Comptesse Mahaut d’Artois (1316), an émouchoir
with silver handle; of Queen Clémence (1328), an émouchoir of silk brocade;
and also in the will or testament of Queen Johanne of Évreux (1372), a
jewelled émouchoir costing five golden francs.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>The cockade form, <i>à la cocarde</i>, has been in use during all periods
subsequent to its first introduction from the East in the early centuries of
our era. We have already referred at some length to the cockade flabella at
Tournus and Monza. In an inventory of Charles <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span> of France, 1380, we read
of ‘un esmouchouer rond, qui se ploye, en yvoire, aux armes de France et de
Navarre, à un manche d’ybenus.’<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>During the fourteenth century, the long-handled flabellum was also in
use, waved by attendants as at Thebes and Rome. In the inventory above
quoted (Charles <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>) occurs—‘Trois bannières, ou esmouchoers, de cuir
ouvré, dont les deux ont les manches d’argent dorez.’ ‘Deux bannières de
France, pour esmoucher le Roy quand il est à Table, semées de fleurs de
lys brodées de perles.’<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>The feather-fan, also, was in use during this reign, as we learn from
a curious entry in a letter of the Queen—alluding to a criminal prosecution
against some manufacturer of spurious coin—‘Le suppliant trouva
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">Pg 101</a></span>d’aventure un esventour de plumes, duquel il esceuta le feu—où l’on faisoit
la ditte fausse monnoye.’<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>The feather and tuft fans in use from the twelfth to the sixteenth
centuries and later were formed of the plumes of the peacock, the ostrich,
and the paroquet, dyed various colours: the number of the feathers varied
from three to twenty or more, and were arranged so as to imbricate the plumes
in the gradation of their natural growth. These were set in handles of
carved ivory and the more precious metals, generally silver, and were often
richly jewelled, and suspended from the girdle by a slender chain. Of their
cost we have a hint in Marston’s satires:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘How can she keepe a lazie serving-man</div>
<div class="line">And buy a hoode and silver-handled fan</div>
<div class="line">With fortie pound?’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Silver was probably the material of the handle of Mistress Bridget’s fan
in the theft of which Falstaff and his Ancient were implicated.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><span class="smcap">Falstaff.</span><span style="padding-left:6em;">And when Mistress Bridget</span></div>
<div class="line i6">Lost the handle of her fan, I took’t upon</div>

<div class="line"><span class="smcap">Pistol.</span><span style="padding-left:3em;">Didst thou not share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>References to the silver-handled fan occur commonly in old plays:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘She hath a fan with a short silver handle,</div>
<div class="line">About the length of a barber’s syringe.’</div>
<div class="line i10"><i>The Floire</i>, 1610.<br /><br /></div>
<div class="line i04">‘All your plate, Vasco, is the silver handle of</div>
<div class="line">Your old prisoner’s fan.’</div>
<div class="line i10"><i>Love and Honour</i>, Sir W. Davenant, 1649.<br /><br /></div>
<div class="line i11">‘Another he</div>
<div class="line">Her silver handled fan would gladly be.’</div>
<div class="line i10">In Marston, <i>Scourge of Villainie</i>, lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> sat. 8.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The above references are to fans of the ordinary sort; the cost of the
more precious fans of history was considerable. Brantôme (<i>c.</i> 1590) refers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">Pg 102</a></span>to the fan of Queen Eleanor with its mirror all ornamented with precious
stones of great value, and also to the new-year’s gift of Queen Margaret to
Queen Louise of Lorraine—a jewelled fan of mother of pearl of such beauty
and richness that it was valued at more than fifteen hundred crowns,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> a sum
equal to a thousand pounds of our present money.</p>

<p>The employment of the fan as fire-screen is indicated by the new-year’s
gift to Queen Mary of England in 1556, when she received ‘seven fannes to
kepe the heate of the fyer, of strawe, the one of white silke.’</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth’s partiality for fans is historic, and it is upon record
that she regarded a fan as a suitable gift for a queen.</p>

<p>Leicester’s new-year’s gift in 1574 is recorded: ‘A fan of white feathers
set in a handle of gold, garnished on one side with two very fair emeralds,
and fully garnished with diamonds and rubies; the other side garnished
with rubies and diamonds, and on each side a white bear [his cognisance]
and two pearls hanging, a lion ramping with a white muzzled bear at
his foot.’</p>

<p>Among the new-year’s gifts, 1588-9:—</p>

<p>‘By the Countess of Bath, a fanne of Swanne downe, with a maze of
gilene Velvet, ymbrodered with seed pearles and a very small chayne of
silver gilte, and in the middest a border on both sides of seed pearles,
sparks of rubyes and emerods, and thereon a monster of gold, the head
and breast mother of pearles.</p>

<p>‘By a Gentleman unknown, a fanne of sundry collored fethers, with
a handle of aggets garnished with silver gilte.’</p>

<p>In 1589, ‘a fanne of ffethers, white and redd, the handle of golde,
inameled with a halfe moone of mother of perles, within that a halfe moon
garnished with sparks of dyamonds, and a fewe seede perles on th’ one side,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">Pg 103</a></span>having her majestie’s picture within it: and on the back-side a device with
a crowe over it.’</p>

<p class="right padr2">
‘Geven by Sir Frauncis Drake.’</p>

<p>In 1599:—</p>

<p>‘By Mrs. Wingfeilde, mother of the maydes, four ruffes of lawne and
a fanne.’</p>

<p>From a letter of Rowland Whyte to Sir Robert Sydney, December 13,
1595, we learn that ‘upon Thursday she dined at Kew, my lord keeper’s
(Sir John Packering) house (who lately obtained of her majestie his sute for
£100 a yeare land in fee farm). His intertainment for that meale was great
and exceeding costly. At her first lighting, she had a fine fanne, with a
handle garnished with diamonds.’</p>

<p>It is also recorded that upon her visit to Hawsted Hall, the seat of Sir
Thomas Cullum, she dropped a silver-handled fan into the moat.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>In the year 1600, a commission was issued to the Lord High Treasurer,
the Lord Chamberlain, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Treasurer
of Her Highness’s Chamber, to examine and take a perfect survey of all
‘robes, garments, and jewels,’ as well within the Court as at the Tower and
Whitehall. In this, no less than twenty-seven fans appear. The following
are enumerated:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent">Item, one fanne of white feathers, with a handle of golde, havinge two snakes
wyndinge aboute it, garnished with a ball of diamondes in the ende, and a crowne on
each side within a paire of winges garnished with diamondes, lackinge 6 diamondes.</p>

<p class="indent">Item, one fanne of feather of divers colours, the handle of golde, with a bare and
a ragged staffe on both sides, and a lookinge glass on thone side.</p>

<p class="indent">Item, one handle of golde enamelled, set with small rubies and emerodes, lackinge
9 stones, with a shipp under saile on thone side.</p>

<p class="indent">Item, one handle of christall, garnished with sylver guilte, with a worde within
the handle.</p>

<p class="indent">Item, one handle of elitropia (q), garnished with golde, set with sparks of
diamondes, rubies, and sixe small pearls, lackinge one diamonde.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">Pg 104</a></span></p>

<p>The feather-fan appears in the following portraits of Queen Elizabeth,
painted and engraved:—</p>

<p class="indent">Jesus College: white feather-fan with jewelled handle.</p>

<p>The Newcome picture, now in the National Portrait Gallery: part
of a feather-fan, the portrait being three-quarter length.</p>

<p>Welbeck: a small feather-fan hanging from girdle.</p>

<p>The engraving by Johann Rutlinger: a large feather-fan, the handle of
elaborate design set with jewels. Also pictures at Cobham; Woburn
Abbey; Charlecote Park; Christ Church, Oxford; Penshurst; Powerscourt,
and other places.</p>

<p>The folding-fan was not introduced into this country until the latter
part of the queen’s reign; in the following pictures it appears:—</p>

<p>Jesus College, half length, 1590.</p>

<p>The Ditchley portrait, whole length, 1592; fan attached to the girdle
and held in right hand.</p>

<p>Bodleian Library, portrait attributed to F. Zucharo.</p>

<p>To enumerate the different portraits, painted and engraved, in which
the feather-fan appears, would be an impossible task; sufficient has been
said to indicate the various forms these articles assumed. Reference may,
however, be made to the feather-fan appearing in Renold Elstracke’s
engraving of Anne of Denmark (queen of James <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>.); this consisting of
three large ostrich plumes set in a jewelled handle. To the same engraver’s
portrait of the Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King James, a similar
feather-fan. Also on a monumental brass, illustrated in Lipscomb’s
<i>Buckinghamshire</i>, vol. iii. 291, the wife of John Pen, Esquire, 1641,
appears with an ostrich feather-fan hung from her girdle. In a portrait
attributed to Sebastian del Piombo at Frankfurt is an extremely ornate
feather-fan with a silver handle.</p>

<p>We also obtain an excellent idea of the form these feather-fans assumed
in Italy in the fifteenth century from the engraved design for a hand-screen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">Pg 105</a></span>
by Agostino Carracci (illustrated facing p. 204). This consists of an
admirably designed cartouche enclosing a subject of a satyr and nymphs
bathing; above is a bust of Diana enclosed in a second cartouche, at the
top of which is a head and wings of a Cupid; the whole is surmounted by
a tuft of ostrich feathers. On the same plate are three other medallions,
Neptune and Minerva, a head of Mars, and the Graces, these latter either
intended as alternative subjects or for introduction at the back of the fan.
The engraving is signed ‘Agust. Carazza Inv. e fe.’</p>

<p>The feather-fan was used by both sexes, as we learn from Bishop Hall,
describing a fashionable gallant:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘When a plum’d fan may shade thy <i>chalked</i> face,</div>
<div class="line">And lawny strips thy naked bosom grace.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>An ostrich-plume <i>folded</i> fan is given in a miniature of Mademoiselle
D’Hautefort in the cabinet of M. de la Mésangère. This consists of ten
sticks each with a single feather attached, dyed alternatively yellow and
blue.</p>

<p>Feather-fans continued in general use until the time of Vandyck and
later, and are in evidence in several portraits by this master; indeed the use
of the tuft- and feather-fan has never been completely abandoned, the article
having remained in intermittent use even to the present day.</p>

<p>None of these ancient feather-fans exist in their complete form,
from the perishable nature of the ostrich plume, which, in the lapse
of time, crumbles to fragments, and from this circumstance the remarkable
feather hand-screen in the possession of Mr. Messel is of the highest
interest.</p>

<p>A few handles, however, are to be found in the various collections, both
public and private. A pretty ivory handle of a sixteenth-century Italian
feather-fan is in the Salting collection, at present at South Kensington.
This is delicately carved with two half-length female figures issuing
from acanthus-leaved ornament, and holding a festoon of drapery, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">Pg 106</a></span>
mask of Cupid above. Near the handle end are two winged terminal
monsters.</p>

<p>The head of an ivory-fan handle, also Italian of the same period, is in
the South Kensington collection: this has a female terminal (head restored)
and two dolphins forming the top, two masks on either side, with other
terminals and cornucopiæ.</p>

THE establishment of the Portuguese as a
conquering power in the far East dates from
the first expedition of Vasco da Gama in 1497.
Five years earlier, Christopher Columbus had
sailed westward over the Atlantic, bearing a
letter from his royal mistress to the great
Khán of Tartary, seeking India and far
Cathay, and finding instead—America.</p>

<p>The three expeditions of Vasco da Gama, during the first twenty years
of the sixteenth century, together with the operations of Alfonso d’Albuquerque,
resulted in the complete supremacy of Portugal as a trading power
with the East. From Japan and the Spice Islands to the Red Sea and the
Cape of Good Hope, they were the sole masters and dispensers of the
treasures of the East,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> and during the whole of the sixteenth century enjoyed
a complete monopoly of the Oriental trade. As early as 1502, the King of
Portugal obtained from Pope Alexander <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span> a bull constituting him ‘Lord of
the Navigation, Conquests, and Trade of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia, and India,’
but it was not until 1516 that the Portuguese made their appearance in China,
where, ‘at Ningpo, they succeeded in establishing a colony, carrying on a
gainful trade with other parts of China, as well as with Japan.’<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> It was thus
that the folding-fan found its way first to Portugal through its traders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">Pg 108</a></span></p>

<p>This introduction of the folding-fan into Europe marks the beginning
of a new era of the fan’s history, as, although both Chinese and Japanese
fans possess qualities which are absolutely individual and unique, yet it
must be confessed that the fan, in the hands of European artists, its early
Oriental influence notwithstanding, ultimately developed a character and
style quite its own, and reflecting the artistic conditions of its epoch and
surroundings.</p>

<p>There are, however, considerable grounds for supposing that some form
of the folding-fan, as we now know it, existed in Europe at a period considerably
anterior to the Portuguese expedition to the East. Viollet-le-Duc,
<i>Dictionnaire Raisonné du Mobilier Français</i>, makes a remarkable statement
in connection with some thin metal fragments which were unearthed during
some excavation at the Château de Pierre. These fragments, says this distinguished
author, which are very characteristic of a fan constructed like
those of our own times, should be anterior to the siege of 1422, as they were
found in the carbonised débris belonging to that epoch. They are composed
of an alloyed metal, <i>cuivre et argent</i>. The piece <i>B</i> represents one of the
outside flats, and was fixed to a guard of wood or very thin metal, to which
was glued the stuff, or vellum; the piece <i>A</i> one of the branch pieces or brins.
M. Viollet-le-Duc infers from the fact of the pieces not being pierced at the
handle end, but finished with a cross, that the branches were tied with a
silken cord, which would also be attached to the waist belt; he points out
the great antiquity of the flabellum (doubtless meaning the cockade form),
and concludes by saying, ‘It is difficult to allow that the fan, which is
merely a derivation of it (<i>qui n’en est qu’un dérivé</i>), was not in use until the
sixteenth century, as several writers have contended.’</p>

<p>M. Viollet-le-Duc’s meaning as to the probable construction of this fan
is not so clearly stated as might possibly be desired. We take it that these
pieces were but the ornaments of a folding-fan formed of ivory, wood, or
other material on the modern principle—that the large piece <i>B</i> formed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">Pg 109</a></span>shoulder, to be completed by another piece forming the guard proper. However
this may be, and whether these pieces really formed part of a folding-fan

<img src="images/i_209a.jpg" width="75" height="251" alt="" />
<span class="caption">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B</span></span>
or not, this author, in the concluding portion of his note,
has expressed a truth which it is not possible to gainsay,
viz. that the principle of the folding-fan already existed, in
the form of the cockade, and that it is only necessary to
divide the cockade in two parts, and to protect the ends with
some firm substance, to arrive at the folded fan as we now
know it. Indeed this was done—fans were carried towards
the close of the sixteenth century which consisted of a
segment of a cockade, inserted in a long handle similar
to that of the plumed fan, thus uniting the characteristics
of both plumed and folded fan. Vecellio, <i>Habiti antichi
et moderni di tutto il mondo</i>, 1590, figures these small
fans, of which two illustrations are given. We are thus
presented with a decorative development which is gradual,
reasonable, and complete, a development quite conceivably

<span class="caption">SMALL RIGID FANS. (From Vecellio.)</span></span>independent of any importation
from the East, and of
itself bridging over the gap
that otherwise would have
existed between two apparently
opposing types.</p>

<p>Any speculations as to
how this fan of M. Viollet-le-Duc
came to exist would therefore
be idle; the type was no new one. We have already referred to the
pleated fan crest, seen on the heads of horses in Phœnician and Persian
monuments.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> A similar fan crest appears on the horse’s head in the</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">Pg 110</a></span></p>
<p>Brétigny seal of Edward III., engraved in consequence of the Treaty of
Brétigny, 1360, by which this monarch renounced the title of King of
France. This appeared again in the seal with the altered legend in which
he resumed the title—the period of its use, 1372-77. This same seal with
fan crest was used successively by Richard <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, Henry <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> (first seal), and
Henry <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span> (silver seal), the legend only altered.</p>

<p>A still more remarkable example is the large displayed fan crest (the
earliest authenticated instance of a regular crest),<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> in the centre of which
is a lion <i>passant</i>, on the top of the flat helmet of Cœur de Lion (second
seal, 1197-99), used after his return from captivity, and quite possibly,
therefore, borrowed from the East.</p>

<p>The fan-plume or panache appears also on the flat-topped helmet of
Alexander <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, King of Scots (second seal); the horse also bearing the
fan-plume.</p>

<p>These fan crests are also seen on the seal of Richard Fitz-Alan,
Earl of Arundel; of Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, 1301; and
of Edward of Carnarvon, Prince of Wales, 1305; and on the effigy of

Sir Geoffrey de Luttrel, <i>c.</i> 1340, showing a fan upon which the entire
Luttrel arms are depicted. A large fan crest, having little tufts of
feathers at each division of the fold, appears on the arms of the family
of Schaler, Basle; another is to be found on the common
seal of the City of London (dated 1539), charged with
the cross of the city arms. ‘In course of time this fan,
in the case of London, as in so many instances, has
through ignorance been converted or developed into a
wing, but the “rays” of the fan in this instance are
preserved in the “rays” of the dragon’s wing (charged
with a cross) which the crest is now supposed to be.’<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>With respect to the origin of these fan crests, we must go back,
says Mr. Fox-Davies, to the bed-rock of the peacock popinjay vanity
ingrained in human nature; the same impulse which nowadays leads to
the decoration of the helmets of the Life Guards with horse-hair plumes
and regimental badges, the cocked-hats of field-marshals and other
officers with wavy plumes.... The matter was just a combination of
decoration and vanity.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing instances, it is abundantly clear that
the folding-fan, though it may have been in intermittent use during these
early periods, obtained no great vogue in Europe until the sixteenth century,
when it was in general use in Portugal, Spain, and Italy, and that the
prevalence of the fashion was resultant upon the influx of Eastern
manufactures.</p>

<p>The feather-fan, referred to in the last chapter, although regarded
as the sign of nobility, was occasionally carried by the wives of the rich
merchants of Venice. A noble Venetian matron carries a tuft fan with
a mirror in the centre garnished with pearls; the plumed fan is seen in
the hands of the noble demoiselles of Milan, of married Genoese ladies,
of the noble matrons of Siena, the latter of whom, together with
the ladies of Venice, Perugia, and other cities, also carried the flag-fan.</p>

<p>The smaller fan, with long thin handle, surmounted with five or
seven feathers set symmetrically, is carried by the Parmese, Ferrarese, and
Florentine ladies, and by the noble matrons of Genoa.</p>

<p>The Milanese ladies carried a fan made apparently of feathers, rigid,
and bound round in five sections. The married ladies of Naples and
Bologna carried rigid screens designed in the form of a cartouche of the
strap-work so usual in sixteenth-century Renaissance ornament. The
later hand-screens, seen in the engravings of Callot and others, were
obviously a development of this form.</p>

<p>The above instances are cited from the engraved work of A. de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">Pg 112</a></span>
Bruÿn,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> in which also appears a long-handled fan of seven feathers carried
by a Turkish lady.</p>

<p>In an earlier work by the same engraver, <i>Imperii ac Sacerdotii
ornatus</i>, 1579, a bishop holds in his left hand the feather fan, in his right
a crozier.</p>

<p>In the art library, Victoria and Albert Museum, are several designs
for feather-fans and handles, by an unknown artist, but certainly Italian,
drawn vigorously with a pen and washed with bistre. In the same collection
is a design in pencil for the panache of a folding-fan, in the
Italian manner, displaying great knowledge of Renaissance design.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the seventeenth century, and indeed earlier,
small screens were the fashion, painted either with love scenes, inscribed
with suitable verses, or views of Italian towns, with a short description,
and were sold for a sum equivalent to an English groat.</p>

<p>The English traveller, Thomas Coryat, in his <i>Crudities</i> (1608),
writes: ‘These fans both men and women of the country [Italy] do carry
to cool themselves withal in the time of heat, by the often fanning of
their faces. Most of them are very elegant and pretty things, for whereas
the fan consisteth of a painted piece of paper and a little wooden handle,
the paper, which is fastened at the top, is on both sides most curiously
adorned with excellent pictures.’ These, probably, are the fans referred
to above as seen in Vecellio and the work of other engravers. Many were
apparently rigid, and probably formed of ivory or similar hard substance;
the size would be about six inches. They were by no means confined
to Italy, but became the vogue in Spain, France, and other
countries.</p>

<p>A long fan, carried by a noble Neapolitan lady, is given by Hefner-Altenek,
in his work on costume. This is apparently rigid, since no sign
of pleating is apparent in the representation, which is, however, small.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">Pg 113</a></span></p>
<p>The colour is blue with decorations of gold, the figure taken from a
picture in an album in the possession of this author, 1596-1611.</p>

<p>Doubtless one of the earliest forms of the folded fan in Italy was the
so-called ‘duck’s foot,’ used by the ladies of Ferrara; the leaf, which
opened to a quarter of a circle, was formed of alternate strips of vellum
and mica, with delicately painted ornaments. The stick was of ivory
and consisted of eight narrow blades. Blondel would seem to infer that
this type of fan originated in France, and cites a contemporary portrait
of ‘un personnage du Bal sous Henri III.’ A fan, evidently the ‘duck’s
foot,’ with a pattern agreeing with the system of mica or other insertion,
appears in an engraved portrait of Louise de Lorraine, queen of Henri <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></p>

<p>This form of fan is, however, probably Italian in its origin; it is
figured by Vecellio, in the hands of a lady of Ferrara; it is also seen in
the earlier engraved work of de Bruÿn, above referred to.</p>

<p>Legendary accounts of the woes of the unfortunate Torquato Tasso,
who had dared to ‘lift his love’ to a princess of the house of Este, have
afforded many themes for the imagination of subsequent writers from
Byron and Goethe downwards. The story of the fan of Eleonora d’Este,
which was of the form above described, surmounted with rubies, is a
pretty one, and may be given for what it is worth.</p>

<p>On a day when reading to the princess his <i>Gerusalemme</i>, in which
the episode of Olindo and Sofronia in the second canto was intended as
portraying Tasso’s own situation with regard to her, his enraptured
listener, won by the charm of the moment, was on the point of yielding,
when, by a supreme effort, she recalled herself to her sense of duty, hesitated
for a moment, grasped her fan, kissed it, flung it at the poet’s feet—and
fled.</p>

<p>This association of vellum and mica appears to have been pretty
general for the leaves of the folding-fans upon their first introduction in
the middle of the sixteenth century. There were two different systems:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">Pg 114</a></span>
in the one, the decoration consisted of painting on the plain surface of
the mica or vellum, or both, as in the fan of Ferrara, or the Actæon fan,
described on page 146; and in the other, the leaf is cut to such a degree
of elaboration as almost to rival the finest lace, as in the charming fan
in the Musée de Cluny, illustrated.</p>

<p>The system of mica insertion was developed until fans were made
entirely of this material, with painted arabesque decoration similar in
character to that of the Actæon fan at Cluny, illustrated page 146. An
extremely interesting example is illustrated from the collection of Mr.
L. C. R. Messel. In this, the stick is of plain ivory, perforated on the
panaches, the blades numbering thirteen. The leaf is divided into three
rows of twenty-five panels each, decorated with a medley of arabesques
of children, animals, birds, and flowers, the panels separated by narrow
borders in blue and black.</p>

<p>Of découpé fans, no finer example could be given than that from
the Musée de Cluny, the stick of which is composed of ten blades of
bone, the two outer ones extending the whole length of the leaf, the rest
to a little less than half-way across. The leaf, which occupies exactly
three-fourths of the whole length, is of paper cut to an extremely refined
geometrical pattern of circles and lozenges, with small, and even minute
pieces of mica inserted at intervals, imparting a richness and variety to
the fan without destroying its lightness and elegance.</p>

<p>This type of fan appears constantly in the portraits, both painted
and engraved, of the latter half of the sixteenth century. It reached
England, apparently, about 1590, or a little earlier, and is seen in the
portraits of Queen Elizabeth painted about this date.</p>

<p>This art of elaborate perforation (découpé) is essentially Italian in
its origin, and was evidently practised to a considerable extent during the
period we have been considering. In the fan which has become associated
with Mademoiselle Desroches, the utmost degree of elaboration is attained,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">Pg 115</a></span>and this example may be accepted as a type of a number of fans produced
during the seventeenth century and later.</p>

<p>It was at a gathering of wits at Poitiers in 1579 that Étienne
Pasquier, perceiving a flea on the neck of Mlle. Desroches, exclaimed
that ‘la petite bestiole’ deserved to be immortalised. A collection of
poems in Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, was published in
Paris in 1582, under the title of <i>La Pulce de Mademoiselle Desroches</i>,
the most felicitous of these plaisanteries being, according to La Monnaye,
from the pen of the lady herself.</p>

<p>The fan leaf, said to commemorate this event, once in the possession
of the fair Pompadour, and now in the Jubinal collection at Paris, is of
paper, elaborately cut to imitate lace. This leaf—the stick has long since
perished—was exhibited at the great exhibition of fans at South Kensington
in 1870. It bears five finely painted miniatures representing the
senses; in the centre picture (touch) a young man places his finger on the
bosom of a sleeping lady, the spot on the neck presumably representing
‘la petite bestiole.’<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>The charming fan in the possession of Mr. L. C. R. Messel was
obtained in Florence. The vellum leaf is finely perforated throughout; the
large centre cartouche and series of small oblong panels are painted with
exquisite minuteness and care. The character of the decoration is that of
the later years of the seventeenth century, the stick of a subsequent date.</p>

<p>The great spirit of the Renaissance had well-nigh exhausted itself
by the time the folded fan had become the vogue in Europe. Michael
Angelo, the last of the Titans, died in 1564, and had lived long enough
to witness the gradual extinction of the school he in great part created.
Pierino del Vaga and Sebastian del Piombo had died seventeen years
earlier.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">Pg 116</a></span></p>
<p>The eclectic principle, developed to its highest attainable point by
Raphael, Michael Angelo, Leonardo, was carried on by a crowd of men
working on similar lines, but possessing far less knowledge and power,
and what was vital truth in the work of the master was reduced to mere
affectation in the hands of the follower.</p>

<p>During the closing years of the century, Italian art, it is true,
received some sort of impetus as a result of the labours of the Carracci,
but the revival was short-lived, and it remained to Guido, Guercino,
Albani, Maratta, to continue the declension during the seventeenth, to
be followed by Tiepolo and Canaletto in the eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p>It would serve no good purpose to quarrel with the painted folding-fan
on account of its inability to rise to the high ideals of the quattro and
cinque-cento. It belonged to a less spacious age, and if it descended
to banality, it was because the times had become banal: it was entirely in
tune with its surroundings.</p>

<p>It will be convenient, at this juncture, to describe in detail the
various elements composing this fan-type which has easily distanced all
others in the affections of the fair—a triumph so absolute and complete,
that to ninety-nine women out of every hundred the idea of a fan is an
instrument which may be folded.</p>

<p><span class="figleft200" style="width: 200px;">

</span>The folding-fan, then, is made
up of two principal parts—the stick
(<i>la monture</i>) <i>B B</i> and the leaf or
mount (<i>la feuille</i>)<i> A</i>. The former
consists of a number of blades
(<i>brins</i>) <i>C C C C</i>, which have varied
at different periods, and are folded
between two guards (<i>panaches</i>) <i>D</i>.
The guard is made up of three dimensions: the handle-end (<i>la tête</i>) <i>I</i>,

<p>The stick of the richer painted fans is composed of either ivory,
mother of pearl, tortoise-shell, or bone: often carved with great minuteness,
elaboration, and skill, and further enriched by gilding and inlay,
painted miniatures, enamels, and precious stones; that of the less elaborate
fan is of wood of various kinds—ebony, rosewood, bamboo, etc. It is
also carved, gilt, inlaid, or lacquered in different ways.</p>

<p>The character of Italian sticks is that of simplicity and reticence,
even to plainness, this being more in keeping with the generally
grave character of the mounts. In a number of instances the brins
present a perfectly flat, plain surface of ivory, relieved only by a little
carving on the panaches. This is ornamented in various ways, the most
characteristic method being that of gold and silver piqué. The work is
done by means of a drill, the metal pressed into the spaces.</p>

<p>One of these Italian fans of the end of the seventeenth century, with
plain white stick, is in the Wyatt collection, the skin mount painted with
the Storming of Jerusalem, and the miraculous curing of Godfrey de
Bouillon’s wound, the guards piqué with silver.</p>

<p>The beautiful Italian fan, with sea-nymphs upon a sandy shore, once
belonging to the unfortunate Marie-Antoinette, and now in the possession
of Mr. Burdett-Coutts, is an example of the best quality of piqué work.
The stick is of horn of a light transparent golden hue. The panaches
bear the crown and fleur-de-lys of France, and appear to be of somewhat
later date than the brins and feuille, which may be put about 1760. The
fan was acquired in Paris during the troublous times of the Revolution
by the father of the late Rev. J. E. Edwards of Trentham, and exhibited
by the last named at South Kensington in 1870. Upon the death of
Mr. Edwards in 1885 it was purchased by the late Baroness Burdett-Coutts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">Pg 118</a></span></p>

<p>Another method of ornamentation is that of delicate piercing, the
surface of the stick remaining flat and without carving. These pierced
ivory sticks are occasionally alternated with those of another material, as
light golden tortoise-shell, horn, and, in an instance in the Wyatt collection,
with a mount of classical landscape and Pompeian ornament,
pierced cedar.</p>

<p>The Italians, as also the Greeks, discovered early the resources offered
to the artist by the material of ivory. Ariosto in his sixth elegy makes a
charming reference to it in addressing his mistress:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘As when ivory or marble wrought by the hand of the artist becomes
unchangeable, so my heart, more inflexible than these, though it may fear the
hand of the assassin, is incapable of receiving the image of any new love to remove
thine which is engraven upon it.’</p></blockquote>

<p>The richest sticks are either those in which the piercing is associated
with carved panels or cartouches of figures, ornament, etc., with the
ribbed backgrounds familiar to us in Chinese workmanship, or those of
which the whole surface is treated in the most delicate relief, exhibiting
the most consummate skill of handling. This is occasionally further
enriched by gilding, silvering, and painting; in some instances, these
several processes are associated, with the addition of mother-of-pearl and
tortoise-shell inlay.</p>

<p>Mother-of-pearl is treated in precisely the same way as ivory, <i>i.e.</i>
flat-pierced; pierced and carved; pierced, carved, and engraved; with, in
some instances, the addition of painting, and occasionally tinsel and
silvering or gilding.</p>

<p>The various kinds of mother-of-pearl used in the manufacture of fans
are as follows:—The Burgan or Burgandine pearl obtained from Japan;
the white pearl, ‘poulette,’ from Madagascar; a black mother-of-pearl from
the East. The shells being relatively small, it becomes necessary to
piece them together by a system of splicing. This is done so skilfully

inlay and incrustation, the splendid Eastern pearl called ‘gold fish’ is
used. This, upon its introduction, caused a complete revolution in the
‘éventail de luxe’; the magnificent rainbow tints of this pearl are said
to be further enhanced by a process invented by M. Meyer.</p>

<p>Tortoise-shell follows the same principle of decorative development,
and when piqué is employed, it is usually gold, as being more in harmony
with the colour of the shell.</p>

<p>The ‘éventail brisé’ dates from the period of the first introduction
of the folded fan into Europe. This is so named because it has no
mount, but is entirely made up of a number of blades, which may be of
any material—ivory, mother-of-pearl, the various woods, etc., and are
painted, carved, or otherwise decorated, fastened at the head by means
of a pin or rivet, and further connected with a ribbon running through
each blade, at or near the circumference of the fan.</p>

<p>The earliest are those which were imported in such large quantities
from the East, from the latter part of the sixteenth century onwards.
The Western modification of these is seen in that class of fans
produced in Italy and elsewhere during the latter part of the
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, which consisted of a system
of flat, pierced scroll-work, of a somewhat severe and reticent character.
This was supplemented by panels <i>en cartouche</i> painted and gilt, with portions
of the ornament enriched with gold and colour; these usually
opened out to rather less than a third of a circle. Miss Moss of Fleet
possesses an interesting example with a painted ‘pastorale’ of three
figures in the centre of the fan, together with lesser subjects <i>en cartouche</i>,
the floral portion of the scroll ornament being emphasised with colour.</p>

<p>In the Wyatt collection is an interesting example of about 1730,
in which the ornament forms a large cartouche in the centre, enclosing
a subject of two Cupids holding a wreath over a heart with a canopy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">Pg 120</a></span>
above. The cartouche is gilt and the figures painted; the lower portion
of the fan is painted and gilt with flowers in the Chinese taste. The
guards are carved, painted, and gilt; the connecting ribbon of green
silk ornamented with a pattern in gold.</p>

<p>This system was practised later, with the addition of carving in low
relief, the ornament having developed a rococo character.</p>

<p>Horn is treated in the same process of flat piercing: this was extensively
practised during the whole of the eighteenth century, and many
‘minuet’ fans were made. A beautiful Italian example of these ‘minuet’
fans is in the Wyatt collection, decorated with silver spangles, with a
white silk connecting ribbon.</p>

<p>Double or reversible fans open both ways—either from left to right
or the reverse. These were in vogue during the latter years of the
eighteenth century, and were made of various materials, but usually ivory,
with painted ornaments. The most interesting were, however, those
of sandalwood, with three printed medallions on either side of the fan,
giving twelve subjects. The device, although surprising at first sight,
is really simple, and consists of printing each blade with portions of
two different subjects in the centre, one set of halves being exposed, the
other covered by the blade next following.</p>

<p>These fans were common to most of the Western countries of
Europe, a large number being made in England with subjects after
Angelica Kauffmann and others.</p>

<p>The materials employed for the mount are chicken skin (so called,
but really kid subjected to a particular treatment), asses’ skin, vellum,
parchment, silk of various kinds, satin, lace, and paper.</p>

<p>The leaf or mount is sometimes single, but more often double. Those
of the richer fans are painted either in transparent colour or in gouache
(body colour); the latter, however, must not be applied too thickly on
account of its liability to crack.</p>

<p>When the leaf is ready for mounting,<i> i.e.</i> after the painting is
finished, it is pleated in a mould consisting of two pieces of thick,
strong paper or cardboard, specially prepared with a coating of an oily
nature; the leaf being placed between, and the mould closed and
pressed. The brins are then introduced between the folds, and fixed by
means of glue. This mould was invented about 1760, and the manufacture
of it has remained since that date in the French family of Petit.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>
‘This operation of pleating,’ says M. Duvelleroy (<i>Rapports du Jury
International, Exposition Universelle</i>, 1867, vol. iv.), ‘very simple at
present, was formerly very complicated; it was necessary for the éventaillistes
to exercise the most scrupulous exactitude; now the mould
dispenses with this care.’</p>

<p>Nothing that woman uses in the great art of pleasing can, however,
be considered simple; do you doubt this fact? asks Charles Blanc,
speaking of the modern collective mercantile system, rather than that of
the artist, who begins his work and carries it to completion with his own
hands. ‘No less than fifteen or twenty persons are employed in the
making of a fan, which passes through three series of operations—1st,
the work of the stick, in which are employed the cutter, the carver,
the polisher, the gilder, the inlayer, the riveter, and sometimes the jewel
setter, who inserts the precious stones; 2nd, the leaf, which requires the
designer, painter, or printer as the case may be; 3rd, the work altogether,
employing the gluer, and in the case of spangled or embroidered fans, the
embroiderer or sempstress, and the folder or pleater.’ Finally, as in
fitting, the last finishing touches—the tassels, tufts, and marabouts are
added by the deft hand of a woman, and to quote again Charles Blanc,
‘when this formidable weapon of coquetry is completed, it is enclosed in
a case, like a well-tempered blade in its sheath.’<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">Pg 122</a></span></p>

<p>The most distinctive Italian mounts are those in which the whole
field is occupied by subjects, usually from classic mythology. These are
either direct replicas or rearrangements of the works of the later Italian
masters—Giulio Romano, the Carracci, Guido, Guercino, as well as those
French artists who either worked in Italy, or whose works found their
way to that country, as Poussin, who spent the greater part of his life in
Rome, Le Brun, and others. In these the chief interest centres in the
mount, which is usually deep, and generally of skin, but occasionally of
paper. The painting is in pure water-colour and also in gouache. In
many instances these leaves have never been mounted; in others, the
mount has been removed from the stick, and framed as a picture. None
can with any measure of certainty be traced to a master-hand, although a
fan appeared at the exhibition held in Drapers’ Hall (1878), which is
declared to be by Pietro da Cortona (Berrettini), 1596-1667, and said to
have belonged to the Marquise de Pompadour.</p>

<p>One of the earliest of these fan-mounts is in the possession of Mr.
J. G. Rosenberg of Karlsruhe; the subject Orpheus and Iphigenia, the
date about 1670. In the Jubinal collection is a Rape of the Sabines, an
original design by F. Romanelli, who was employed by Louis XIV. on
the frescoes in the Bibliothèque Mazarine.</p>

<p>Bacchus and Ariadne was a favourite subject—Guido’s well-known
composition in the Accademia di Luca, at Rome, being often pressed into
the service. The large engraving of Jacobus Freij was issued in 1727, and
it is probable that the majority of mounts decorated with this subject
were produced after the publication of the engraving. The version
illustrated is from the collection of Lady Northcliffe; a skin mount, with
slight differences in the arrangement, was exhibited at South Kensington
in 1870 by Captain J. E. Ottley; a third is in the cabinet of an American
collector.</p>

<p>The famous composition by Annibale Carracci in the Farnese Palace
also appears on a number of mounts; a portion of this picture forms the
subject of the centre medallion of Lady Northcliffe’s fan (illustrated).</p>

<p>The still more popular ‘Aurora’ of Guido supplied the subject of
many mounts, including one in the Schreiber collection, British Museum.</p>

<p>Fans painted with Raphael’s well-known composition of the ‘Marriage
of Cupid and Psyche,’ in the Villa Farnesina at Rome, appear in many
collections, the landscape being added; the example illustrated is a typical
one; the stick, however, is modern.</p>

<p>The fan in the Wyatt collection with the subject of Venus and Adonis,
by Leonardo Germo of Rome, is interesting from the fact that it is an
example of an artist, who, apparently, signed a number of fans, and also
from the circumstance that it formerly belonged to Benjamin West. The
mount is kid, the stick tortoise-shell, engraved, silvered, and gilt.</p>

<p>A fan with the subject of the Triumph of Mordecai, signed ‘Germo,’
was exhibited at South Kensington in 1870 by M. Chardin of Paris.</p>

<p>Another example in the possession of Lady Northcliffe has an allegorical
subject by Germo, on skin, the stick of ivory finely carved, the
guards mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>Somewhat akin to the mounts above described are those elaborate
compositions finely drawn in India ink, with pen or brush, on skin mounts,
usually vellum. These, from the absence of colour, were used as mourning
fans, the sticks invariably of ivory, piqué, or carved; they are included in
most collections that make any pretension to completeness. Lady Bristol
possesses one with the subject of Bacchus and Ariadne after Carracci; but
by far the most splendid example of this class of fan appeared in the Walker
sale in 1882. This is a crowded composition of the Triumph of Alexander
(after Le Brun), in which the conqueror is seated in a chariot drawn by
elephants; on the reverse the death of Actæon. The stick and guards
mother-of-pearl, carved with Cupids and ornaments, painted in panels with
episodes in the life of Alexander. Finely variegated gilding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">Pg 124</a></span></p>

<p>These fans are characteristically Italian, certainly Italian in their
origin. Their production, however, was by no means confined to Italy.
M. Duvelleroy has a Dutch example with ivory stick carved <i>à jour</i>, the
mount vellum, the subject on the obverse representing an embarkation
with numerous figures, on the reverse a dance of peasants with musicians.
(Illustration facing p. 192.)</p>

<p>Neapolitan fans divide themselves into two distinct classes or groups—the
first having a figure subject <i>en cartouche</i> in the centre, usually
taken from classic mythology, the field being occupied by that form of
arabesque (grotteschi), so usual in Pompeian wall decoration.</p>

<p>This class of mount dates from the re-discovery and unearthing of
Pompeii in 1748, and its production was continued until the end of the
century and later. Two excellent examples are given from the collection of
Mrs. Bruce Johnston, formerly in the possession of Lord Bessborough.
The one with the subject of Bacchus and Ariadne, from a fresco at Pompeii,
bought in Naples by Lady Duncannon; the other of a sacrificial subject,
also from a Pompeian fresco, obtained in the same city (in the eighteenth
century) by Lady Ponsonby.</p>

<p>Many of these mounts have, in lieu of a single central subject, several
miniatures <i>en cartouche</i>, associated with arabesques similar in character to
those above referred to. A good example appears in the Wyatt collection at
South Kensington.</p>

<p>In the second type of Neapolitan mounts, the field is similarly divided
into panels, usually one superior and two inferior, representing views,
generally the bay of Naples with Vesuvius in the distance, forming the
centre panel, and Vesuvius in eruption, and a classic ruin on either
side. These, with other Italian views, as the Colosseum in Rome, form a
very large class; the panels being associated with arabesque or other
ornaments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">Pg 125</a></span></p>

<p>Another, important class of Italian mounts gives a view of some famous
building or place, occupying the whole field of the fan. Of this, no finer
example could be given than the magnificent fan in the possession of
Mr. W. Burdett-Coutts, M.P., of the Piazza of St. Mark’s, Venice, after
Canaletto (Antonio Canal, b. 1687, d. 1768). The mount is skin; on the
right is a group of performing acrobats surrounded by spectators; on
the left some strolling players, with peregrinic theatre; on the reverse
a view of Venice from the sea. The stick ivory, carved <i>à jour</i>, with
characters of the pantomime, some being gilt and painted in ‘vernis Martin,’
others in the pure ivory; the guards carved with marks and musical
trophies.</p>

<p>These acrobats, one of the popular Venetian amusements of the period,
appear in ‘A Fête on the Piazzetta,’ school of Canaletto, in the Wallace
collection.</p>

<p>This fan, together with one of a similar class, with a view of St. Peter’s
at Rome, was acquired by the late Baroness at the Walker sale in 1882.</p>

<p>Fans were made for children in Italy and most other countries during
the eighteenth century. These were both painted and printed, the latter
variety often having the numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, on the leaf,
doubtless as serving an educational purpose. A collection of these
children’s fans was exhibited by Miss Marie Josephs at Drapers’ Hall
in 1890.</p>

<p>The beautiful Italian fan, ‘Cupid’s Hive,’ contributed by Lady Bristol,
is so charming in the skill of its painted leaf, and the delicate carving of its
ivory-jewelled stick, that it is difficult to conceive of its having been placed
in the hands of a child. These fans occasionally appear in painted portraits,
the Infanta Margaretha-Theresia, by Velasquez, in the Vienna Gallery,
being an instance.</p>

<p>The foregoing includes all the principal types of fans produced in
Italy during the period we have under consideration; they each present
well-marked characteristics, and are therefore not difficult of identification.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">Pg 126</a></span>
We have abundant written testimony to the superiority of the Italian
workmen during the seventeenth century, and to the extent of the Italian
export trade in fans during this period and even later. We have also
the evidence of the fans themselves; we shall see, too, how the Paris
éventaillistes first learned their craft from the Italian workmen who
migrated northward. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, however,
a complete change had taken place in the conditions of fan production,
this period witnessing the rise of the French export trade, and the middle
of the century its highest development, at which latter period Paris supplied
not only Italy but Spain, and to some extent England also. Of this we
have more than a hint from the pen of one of the most distinguished
Italians of the latter half of the century.</p>

<p>The fan of Goldoni’s comedy was one of the ordinary sort, ‘not worth
perhaps five paoli.’ The concluding lines of the play make it clear that
a considerable trade in the cheaper French fans was done in Italy at this
period (1763), and, by inference, that Paris fans had the best reputation,
unless indeed we are to suppose that this was a compliment paid by
Goldoni to the country of his adoption, from which, too, he enjoyed a
pension:</p>

<h3>PAINTED FANS OF THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH
CENTURIES—<i>Continued</i></h3>

<h4>SPANISH</h4>

<p><span class="figleft100" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/i_245.jpg" width="100" height="176" alt="" />
<span class="caption">RIGID SCREEN<br />(Carried by the married ladies
of Bologna.)</span></span>The Spaniards, says Henri Estienne, carried towards
1440 large round screens garnished with plumes, and
in the sixteenth century folded fans, <i>éventails plissés</i>,
enriched with gold and attached to the waist by a
gold cord. Of these latter, many, doubtless, were imported
from Italy; few, probably, were of native workmanship.
A very small pleated fan appears in the
hand of a Spanish lady, illustrated in Vecellio, 1590.
The rigid flag-fan employed in Italy at this period
was also used in Spain, together with the various
plumed fans, some in the shape of a peacock’s tail; others formed of
the feathers of the ostrich, pheasant, parrot, and Indian raven. During
the seventeenth century and later, a large export trade in unpainted
pleated fans was done in Paris to Madrid and other Spanish cities,
where they were decorated by native artists; many were exported complete,
the authenticity of many so-called Spanish fans must always therefore
remain a more or less doubtful question. The well-known story
of Cano de Arevalo, given in Quilliet’s <i>Dictionnaire des peintres
espagnols</i>, sufficiently testifies to the extent of the Paris export trade
and the popularity of French fans during this period. This painter,
who was a capable miniaturist, finding himself impoverished after a
period of extravagance and dissipation, secluded himself for a whole
winter, produced a number of fans, and passed them off as newly-imported
French ones. The trick proved completely successful, for upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">Pg 128</a></span>
its discovery, he was not only hailed as a master, but was subsequently
appointed <i>abaniquero</i> (fan-maker) to the queen. Cano was born at
Valdemoro in 1656, and was assassinated in a bull-fight at Madrid in
1696. From the same source (Quilliet) we learn that Cano also ‘essayed
water-colour painting on a larger scale, but only succeeded with fans,’
which are still esteemed, the few that are preserved.</p>

<p>This success of Cano must necessarily have given a considerable
impetus to the native production of fans, largely used from the fifteenth
century onwards by men as well as women.</p>

<p>In brief, the story of Spanish painting during the whole of the
sixteenth century is that of a general migration of Spanish artists to
Italy for purposes of study, with a consequent strong Italian influence; and
an immigration of Italian artists to Spain, chiefly at the invitation of
Charles <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span> The seventeenth century witnessed the rise and full development
of a purely native school of painting, headed by Velasquez and
Murillo, who, however, can scarcely be said to have exercised any influence
upon the fan, since they were painters pure and simple, <i>i.e.</i> their works
were distinguished by the qualities of the painter rather than those of
the designer; and, especially in the case of Velasquez, their subjects were
unsuitable to the fan.</p>

<p>We do not usually look to the last-named painter for elaboration
of detail. The folding-fan in the hands of the Spanish lady by Velasquez,
‘La Femme à l’Éventail,’ at Hertford House, would appear to be of
leather, judging from the colour and texture, with applied ornaments at
regular intervals. This is probably of the scented variety, <i>peau de
senteur</i>, made both in Italy and Spain at this period.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> We have
already referred to the portrait of the little Infanta Margaretha-Theresia
by Velasquez in the Vienna Gallery, in which a closed folding-fan is
represented.</p>

<p>The interesting fan representing the capture of the Balearic Islands
by the Spaniards in 1759 may be taken as of Spanish workmanship. The
subject is taken from a painting in the Escurial. The stick is ivory, carved
<i>à jour</i> with three cartouches, painted and gilt; in the centre appear figures
of commanders on horseback, a march of troops on the one side and warships
on the other; the background ‘gold-fish’ inlay. The paper mount is painted
in gouache; and on the reverse is a view of a fort. The style of the
painting presents similar characteristics to a fan mount in the Schreiber
collection, British Museum, in which we are introduced to a ‘Carrousel
at Madrid,’ with a large square filled with spectators appearing at the
windows of the houses; in the centre of the background is a pavilion with
the king and suite, inscribed Carlos <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, and a performance of a number
of horsemen led by the ‘Duque de Médinacéli,’ the ‘Marques de Tabara,’
and the ‘Marques de Aztorga.’ The leaf, which has been removed from the
stick, is of paper, painted in gouache. A fan of this subject appeared
in the exhibition of fans at South Kensington in 1870, in the possession
of Madame Charles Heine of Paris; the stick of tortoise-shell, carved
and gilt.</p>

<p>This same king, who succeeded to the Spanish throne in 1759,
figures as the subject of two fan designs in the Schreiber collection,
the one representing his triumphal entry into Naples in 1734 on his
election to the crown of the Two Sicilies, with the subject inscribed
in Spanish; the leaf signed ‘F<sup>o</sup> La Vega Hisp. Let. D.’; below the
picture, ‘Miñado por Cayetano Pichini Romano.’ The other, a companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">Pg 130</a></span>
fan design, represents the sham-fight and siege of Gaeta in 1734 on the
occasion referred to above; a canopy bears the arms of Spain, and on
either side a trophy with the arms of Medicis and Farnese; the subject
inscribed in Spanish: ‘F<sup>oo</sup> La Vega Hispa<sup>s</sup> Bilbilitanus In<sup>v</sup> e Delineavit
Roma’ and ‘Mi<sup>n</sup>ado Por Leonardo Egiarmon Flamenco.’ Both these
fan designs are vigorously drawn with pen in bistre and worked with
India ink, the style betraying a strong late Italian influence.</p>

<p>One of the first acts of Charles, upon his accession to the throne, was
to enter into a treaty with Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span> known as the ‘Pacte de famille,’ by
which these two kings of the house of Bourbon united themselves into an
offensive and defensive alliance. By the terms of this treaty, signed 15th
August 1761, Spain was obliged to take part in the war in which France
and England were then engaged, France hoping to avail herself of the maritime
power of Spain, and to prevent Portugal from declaring common cause
with England. Its only effect, however, was to inflict upon her ally a series
of disasters similar to her own, Spain losing Cuba, Manilla, and the
Philippine Islands, and France Martinique, besides being finally expelled
from Canada, thus completing the work begun by Wolfe at Quebec some
two years previously.</p>

<p>The sequel to these events was the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the preliminaries
of peace being signed at Fontainebleau on the 3rd November of the
previous year.</p>

<p>By the terms of this instrument, Canada, the islands of Minorca,
Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent, Dominica and Tobago were ceded
to Britain, while to France were restored Belleisle on the French coast, the
islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon near Newfoundland, Martinique, Guadaloupe,
Marigalante, Desirade, and St. Lucia in the West Indies. Havannah
was restored to Spain, the Spaniards in return ceding Florida to the English,
and agreeing also to make peace with Portugal.</p>

<p>In <i>La Revue Hispanique</i>, tome viii., appeared an article by M. Gabriel
Marcel, reprinted in pamphlet form under the title of ‘Un Éventail
Historique du dix-huitième siècle, Paris, 1901,’ describing and illustrating
a remarkable fan in the cabinet of a Parisian amateur whose name is not
given, commemorating the event above referred to.</p>

<p>The stick is ivory, carved with an agreeable pell-mell of cartouches, gilt;
the centre being occupied by a <i>conversation galante</i> of four figures in the
costume of the Watteau period.</p>

<p>In the centre of the skin leaf, finely painted in gouache, is a stone
table carved in high relief with figures of Cupids, near which are the Kings
of France and Spain, each accompanied by a female figure representing the
respective countries, and bearing a shield of arms; above, a figure of Peace
crowned with olive leaves appears from the clouds and directs the ceremony.
In the middle distance is a tribune on which are seated three female figures,
with a cornucopia of abundance, and the arms of France and Spain; above
is a figure of Fame with a trumpet.</p>

<p>In the more immediate foreground are the Kings of England and
Portugal, their identity being determined by the blazoning of the shields
which accompany them. Court officials, together with their ladies, complete
the composition.</p>

<p>The reverse, which is less interesting, and probably by another hand,
represents an architectural structure with, again, the arms of France, and
above, those of France and Spain entwined.</p>

<p>Although it is possible that the fan may be of Spanish manufacture, it is
more probably French, since it bears all the characteristics of French work
of the period of Louis Quinze. It was probably made either for a royal
princess, or for the wife of some prominent official who took part in the
negotiations of the treaty.</p>

<p>The classical revival of the middle of the eighteenth century was not
without its effect on Spain; fans being painted in this country also with
subjects from the Greek mythology. At the exhibition at South Kensington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">Pg 132</a></span>
in 1870, the Dowager-Countess of Craven exhibited a large Spanish dress
fan, the mount richly painted on vellum, with a centre subject of Aurora and
Zephyr, the floral ornaments embossed in gold and spangled; the stick
carved ivory and mother-of-pearl, with figures in gold relief variegated and
spangled, jewelled stud.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>Towards the middle of the eighteenth century onwards, a class of fan
was made in which the stick, usually of tortoise-shell, but also of ivory and
other material, was elaborately pierced and carved, occasionally in the most
ornate fashion, the brins numbering from eight to ten, the guards wide,
both being heavily incrusted with gold and silver. The mounts of these
fans were always narrow, measuring about three-sevenths of the length of
the stick. This class of fan, examples of which appear in most collections,
by general consent has been associated with Spain, although, doubtless, it
was produced in other countries also.</p>

<p>One of the earliest of these fans, as well as one of the finest, is that in
the possession of Lady Bristol, described and illustrated in the succeeding
chapter, page 163. This, from the skill displayed in its finely designed
stick, and the style of its delicately painted leaf, is more probably French
than Spanish. Interesting examples of this class of fan are given from the
collections of H.R.H. the Princess Victor of Hohenlohe-Brandenburg and
Mrs. Frank W. Gibson. In the first-named instance the stick is tortoiseshell,
with gold incrustations of figures of Roman warriors, musicians
in the costume of the period of the fan (<i>c.</i> 1780), Cupids, and other ornaments:
the leaf a pretty pastoral; the work, although probably Spanish,
showing a strong French influence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gibson’s fan belonged to her grandmother, who was a Spaniard;
the leaf, probably, represents the betrothal of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XVI.</span> and Marie Antoinette,
Louis being but sixteen at the time of his marriage in 1770. The Austrian
Court was closely allied to that of Spain; and this subject, therefore,
would naturally appeal to the Spaniards. A wedding fan occurs in
the collection of Lady Lindsay, having for its centre medallion a lady’s
dressing-room, with Cupid holding a mirror; on the sides are a Cupid lighting
his torch from an altar, and a Cupid with bow and arrows. The stick of
tortoise-shell, finely silvered and gilt.</p>

<p>A remarkable fan in this same collection was brought from Madrid
by Lady Canning, who accompanied Sir Stratford Canning to Spain on
a special mission from Queen Victoria, and was given to Lady Lindsay in
1878. The stick is of ivory, finely and elaborately carved; the mount,
skin, painted in the Chinese taste; illustrated facing p. 127.</p>

<p>The character of Spanish work of the stick, which, with a few isolated
exceptions, never reached a high level of attainment, materially deteriorated
towards the close of the century. A fan appears in the Schreiber collection,
with ivory stick, indifferently carved and gilt, the silk leaf having for its
subject a large medallion of the surrender of Minorca in 1782, with the
English army evacuating the island, and the Spanish flag waving over the
fort of S. Phelippe; the sides decorated with vases of flowers embroidered,
painted, and spangled; the subject inscribed in Spanish along the top
border of the fan.</p>

<p>Of the treatment of the stick, two interesting examples in the Wyatt
collection may be referred to—the one, belonging to the early part of the
century, in which painted trellis-work in blue and brown is introduced as a
background to finely pierced and carved cartouches of figures and other
subjects, the ornament being enriched with gold; the other with a paper
mount representing the visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon (probably
a church-fan), the mother-of-pearl sticks engraved with three figure subjects
<i>en cartouche</i>, with elaborate scroll-work; the leading features of the
ornament, together with portions of the figures, being emphasised with
thin lines of gold, having an extremely pleasant effect; <i>c.</i> 1750.</p>

<p>Spanish painting in the latter half of the eighteenth century experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">Pg 134</a></span>
some revival in the person of Francisco Goya, one of the most extraordinary
personalities who ever wielded a brush, and whose greatness is only just
beginning to be adequately recognised, chiefly, however, on account of his
etchings, of which he produced a number.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>If we may conceive Goya as ever touching the fan, the example illustrated,
from the collection of Lady Northcliffe, is just such a one as he
might have painted. At any rate this may be considered as a typical
Spanish fan. The silk leaf has in the centre a mounted picador, with six
medallions of bull-fights; above the picador are two Cupids holding a
shield of arms, with thirteen other shields along the upper border, bearing
the arms of Biscaria, Cordova, Majorca, Valencia, Arragonia, Leon, Castillia,
Navarra, Toledo, Gallicia, Andalusia, Murcia, and Catalonia. The shields,
together with the medallions, are bordered with embroidered spangles; the
ivory stick and guards finely pierced and inlaid with gold and silver.</p>

<p>The charming spangled fan in the possession of Mr. Talbot Hughes
may also be accepted as of undoubted Spanish workmanship. In this,
the leaf is of white silk, painted with a female figure in a garden,
arranging flowers from a basket. The head is an applied miniature on
ivory, a device much affected by the Chinese; the necklace, seed pearls
appliqué; the dress completely of spangles. The leaf is enriched with a
border of gold and silver sequins of various forms, some being set with
crystals. The stick ivory, coloured, gilt, and decorated <i>à la paillette</i>.
The date about 1800.</p>

<p>It has been shown, beyond any possibility of doubt, that during the
seventeenth century French exportation of this dainty article to Spain was
considerable, French fans enjoying the best reputation in that country, as
well as in Italy, and that this pre-eminence was maintained during the
succeeding century, the period of the highest development of the fan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">Pg 135</a></span>industry in France; but while it is difficult to associate the native Spanish
workmanship with fans of the highest calibre, a preference for the richer
French fans having always prevailed, it is certain that the production of
the cheaper fans was, and is, considerable, Valencia being the chief centre
of the industry. It is equally certain that in no country in Europe is the
employment of the fan so general, or the toy so gracefully wielded, as in
this land of light, colour, and romance.</p>

<p>Théophile Gautier (<i>Tra los montes</i>) thus refers to the importance of the
fan in Spain: ‘The Fan corrects in some measure the pretension of the
Spaniards to Parisianism. A woman without a fan is a thing I have
never yet seen in that favoured land; I have seen women wearing satin
shoes without any stockings, but they had, nevertheless, their fans, which
follow them everywhere, even to church, where you meet groups of all
ages, kneeling or sitting, praying and fanning themselves with equal
fervour.’</p>

<p>‘We should remember,’ says Disraeli (<i>Contarini Fleming</i>), ‘that here
[Cadiz], as in the north, the fan is not confined to the delightful sex.
The cavalier also has his fan; and, that the habit may not be considered
an indication of effeminacy, learn that in this scorching clime the soldier
will not mount guard without this solace.’</p>

<p>In Spain, as in China and Japan, there is a fan for every occasion—for
the street, where paper ones are used, these affording more breeze on a
sultry day than do lace or silk; for feast days, bull-fights,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> and the theatre,
silk or lace fans, mounted on sandalwood, bone, ivory, or mother-of-pearl.
A favourite material is silk, mounted on a carved wooden frame which
opens and shuts easily, a most essential thing in a Spanish fan, which is
perpetually in motion, portraying the feelings and thoughts that are passing
through the mind of its owner.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">Pg 136</a></span></p>
<p>The fan is in the hands of every one, from the merest baby to the big
toreador, who employs it as a means of exciting the ire of his bovine
adversary. It serves as convenient screen for the dark-eyed beauty, who,
seated in the balcony in the still evening, listens eagerly to the impassioned
serenade beneath.</p>

<p>At the theatre, says Blondel, nothing is more curious than the manipulation
of these instruments, playing with the expressive grace which
is a silent flirtation. Before the play begins, or during the intervals,
every one talks in the midst of a confused noise resembling the buzzing
of an immense swarm of flies. The curtain rises—all resume their places;
the conversation ceases; the fans, everywhere waving in varied movement,
gradually, one by one, tone down into regularity of time; they flutter in
captivating cadence, suggesting in appearance a crowd of variegated
butterflies, and charming the ear with their delightful ‘frou-frou.’</p>

<p>It is this play of the fan (<i>manejo del abanico</i>) in which fair dames
and demoiselles have become such adepts, that it has been necessary to
coin a word to express this charming art. Thus, ‘abanicar’ means the
play of the fan, while ‘ojear’ signifies the language of the eyes. These
two manœuvres, remarks M. Louis Énault shrewdly, are closely allied,
and one alone suffices for a man’s destruction.</p>

<p>The fan, indeed, has its own particular language, more eloquent than
that of flowers—the Spanish <i>novia</i> (lady-love) communicates her thoughts
by code to her <i>novio</i> (sweetheart), as—engaged couples in Spain being
never allowed alone—woman’s ready wit has devised this means of private
conversation.</p>

<p>A shorter code has been published in English (duly copyrighted) by
M. J. Duvelleroy. This, although the principle is the same, differs
materially in the details; thus, ‘I love you’ in Spanish is to hide the
eyes behind the opened fan; in English, to draw the fan across the cheek.
‘I hate you,’ in the former instance, is to raise the shut fan to the
shoulder in the right hand; in the latter, to draw the fan <i>through</i> the
hand: either code being sufficiently expressive and acquired with
tolerable ease.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>PAINTED FANS OF THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH
CENTURIES (FRENCH)</h3>

<span class="caption">FAN OF RICE STRAW<br />
(From a Fifteenth-Century MS.
in the National Library, Paris.)</span></span>The so-called Renaissance of the arts of France in
the sixteenth century was the outcome of an increased
knowledge of, and familiarity with, Italian ideals of
life, and the splendours of a more refined civilisation;
it represented the assimilation of the national spirit,
the union of French ‘netteté d’exécution’ with the more
sober learning of Italian tradition. The beginnings of
this Italian influence are to be discovered earlier, in
the visit of Jean Foucquet to Italy in 1440-1445; this
event being the signal for a general migration of Italian
artists northward.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the fan, however, we are concerned
only with the history of French art from the
period when, in 1530, at the invitation of François I.,
Le Rosso and Primaticcio repaired to Paris for the
purpose of decorating the palace at Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>At this period architecture was creating Chenonceau and Chambord.
Sculpture, in the hands of Cellini and Jean Goujon, was providing the
decorative details for the château then being built by Philibert de l’Orme
for Diana de Poitiers.</p>

<p>In the sister art of Painting, Jean Cousin and François Clouet, together
with Primaticcio, who continued working until 1570, were the
dominant influences.</p>

<p>Simon Vouet, recalled to Paris after a lengthy sojourn in Rome, was
painting the nobles of the French court, and decorating for Richelieu the
Palais Royal and the Château de Rueil. Poussin, French by birth,
Italian and classic in sympathy, found the artistic atmosphere of Rome
more congenial to him. In 1640, upon a pressing invitation from
Louis XIII., he migrated to Paris, but, on account of court intrigues, the
jealousies of his brother artists, and the malignity of Vouet, under pretence
of bringing his wife from Rome, he left Paris in 1642, never to
return.</p>

<p>The pupils of Vouet were Le Sueur and Charles le Brun. With
this latter artist French painting enters upon a new phase, and it is
impossible to overestimate the influence for good or for evil exercised
by him during the latter half of the seventeenth century; nay, it extended
practically over the whole of the century, since he began painting almost
from his infancy.</p>

<p>The work of Le Brun, in spite of its many affectations, possesses
many admirable qualities: such a composition, for example, as ‘The
Entry of Alexander into Babylon,’ now in the Louvre, which, by the way,
appears on an Italian fan in the Wyatt collection, at once stamps him
as a master of decorative arrangement, and is typical both of his qualities
and his limitations.</p>

<p>One of the most significant events in the history of French art was
the founding of the Academy in 1648: in this Le Brun naturally took a
leading part, as also in the foundation of the French School in Rome, of
which he was the first director. The establishment of the Academy had
a direct as well as an indirect bearing upon the fan, since on more than
one occasion it ‘used the power of its prestige in defence of the just
liberties of the éventaillistes.’<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">Pg 140</a></span></p>
<p>Pierre Mignard (Le Romain), the lifelong rival of Le Brun, possessed
something of the grand manner, derived from his study of the
Carracci and Domenichino. In 1664 he was the head of the Academy of
St. Luke, and in 1690, upon the death of Le Brun, he was appointed
Director of the Academy of Painting, a post which he filled until his
death in 1695.</p>

<p>We have said that during the sixteenth century, Italian influences on
French art were paramount—these influences being entirely healthy and
regenerative. Throughout the succeeding century the dominant influence
was still Italian, but its effect was as deleterious as it had been formerly
beneficent.</p>

<p>By 1700 the decorative arts were well on the downward path.
Bernini had been dead twenty years, but his influence, together with
that of Borromini, was still a living thing, and was still working irreparable
mischief. Sir M. Digby Wyatt, in a powerful article written for
Owen Jones’s <i>Grammar of Ornament</i>, referring to Borromini, says:
‘From his fervid imagination and rare facility as a draughtsman and
designer, he soon obtained ample employment; and in his capricious
vagaries, every tendency to extravagance that Bernini’s style possessed
Borromini contrived to caricature. Until his death, in 1667, he continued
sedulously occupied in subverting all known principles of order and
symmetry, not only to his own enrichment, but to the admiration of the
leaders of the fashion of the day. The anomalies he introduced into
design, the disproportionate mouldings, broken, contrasted, and re-entering
curves, ... became the <i>mode</i> of the day, and all Europe was speedily
busy in devising similar enormities. In France the fever raged speedily,
and the popular style, in place of the quaint but picturesque forms to
be seen in the engravings of Du Cerceau, 1576, substituted the more
elaborate but less agreeable ones to be found in Marot, 1727, and
Mariette, 1726-7.... Despite this debasing influence,’ continues our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">Pg 141</a></span>author, ‘many of the French artists of the time, both of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span>, in the midst of their extravagances, made many beautiful ornamental
designs, showing in them a sense of capricious beauty of line rarely
surpassed.’</p>

<p>This, although written at the period of perhaps the very lowest ebb
of the decorative arts, the mid-Victorian era, pretty well sums up the
matter, and is a fair estimate of the decorative tendencies that obtained
at the beginning of the eighteenth century. The general character of the
fan, therefore, necessarily partook of this debasing influence, and reflected
the ornamental vulgarities and fashionable inanities of the time. Thus
we have, in moulded ornament, a profusion of those extravagant shell-like
cartouches which have become identified with the periods of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">XVI.</span>; curly structures elaborately perforated, beginning and ending
at will, observing no reasonable or well-defined law, but expressing only
the caprice of the artist. These either formed the starting-point for the
lighter ornaments, or were associated with naturalistic swags and festoons
of fruit and flowers, masks, ribbons, etc.</p>

<p>With the dawn of the eighteenth century, French <i>pictorial</i> art enters
upon that era of <i>fêtes galantes</i>, <i>conversations galantes</i>, and <i>amusements
champêtres</i>, which, whatever its shortcomings, was purely French and native
to the soil. The pernicious influence of the Italian decadence is about
to be shaken off. Watteau was sixteen years old, and just commencing
those labours which resulted in the practical regeneration of French
painting. He may be said to dominate the art of the eighteenth century
as completely as Le Brun had overshadowed the century which preceded.
He sums up in himself that spirit of the joyousness of life, that careless,
impulsive frivolity which is the note of the age.</p>

<p>His immediate followers, Lancret, Pater, and in some sense De Troy,
carried on the tradition, but with a more pronounced convention: the
shimmer and sheen of silk and satin draperies are painted according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">Pg 142</a></span>
a recipe, the general treatment of the subjects reveals a less delicate
fancy, and a less tender sympathy.</p>

<p>Boucher, friend and servant of La Pompadour, ‘with her fan that
breaks through halberds,’<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> has been styled, with more or less semblance to
truth, the Anacreon of painters. His convention is of an entirely different
order to that of Watteau and his school; but if his method and style is
more artificial, it is because life and manners have become less sincere,
and because he is true to his belief that ‘Nature wanted harmony and
seduction’; he yields nothing to his predecessors in artistic power, he is
completely master of his technique, and understands exactly the measure
of his gifts. In his pupil Fragonard, we have in reality the true heir and
successor of Watteau—the same supple touch, the same alluring grace, the
same captivating invention and suggestiveness which always summons us
to an enchanted land of love, and music, and dalliance.</p>

<p>It was an exceedingly gay, light-hearted, and pleasant time—in painting
at any rate. Strephon sat at the feet of Phyllis, warbling soft nothings
to the accompaniment of the lute. Dan Cupid, who was everywhere in
evidence, took it for granted that his presence was always à propos, and
never troubled his curly head as to whether his decorative surroundings
were in the nicest possible taste. The fan necessarily reflected this eccentricity
and extravagance—indeed it took its natural place in the general
decorative scheme; the ‘dainty rogues’ of the sideboard and mantel-shelf
were in complete harmony with the still more dainty rogues of the fan;
the shepherdess in her flowered skirt rubbed shoulders, or attempted to
do so, with the fine lady in crinoline.</p>

<p>The fun waxed faster and more furious; the times grew madder and
still more mad; the exuberance of the rococo became more and more
pronounced, until no inanity remained untried, no extravagant banality
overlooked. Then came the inevitable reaction. The latter half of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">Pg 143</a></span>century witnessed the sowing of the seed, and, indeed, the full fruition, of
that neo-classicism, which, although a relief from the <i>barocco</i> of the preceding
period, was the outcome of no settled conviction except the
desirability of entering any port in a storm; it had its origin in the
interest which was then being taken in archæology and classical research.</p>

<p>With the Revolution came artistic chaos, and—the nineteenth
century. The cold, correct classicalities of the ‘style de l’Empire’ were
due, in great part, to the influence of the painter David, although the
inauguration of this new epoch was claimed by Vien. The work of David
and that of his immediate followers, Girodet, Gros, Gérard, and Ingres,
represented perhaps the natural antidote to the decorative debauch which
is here passed rapidly in review; its final overthrow was brought about by
that riot of academic tradition in which it subsequently indulged, rather
than by the labours of Delacroix and the school of Romanticists which
followed.</p>

<p>This, in the briefest possible terms, is an account of the general
and more obvious tendencies of French art during the two centuries we
have under consideration. How far, then, and to what extent may we
trace the direct handiwork of these artists upon the fan? What of the
authors of these dainty creations, that fluttered and shimmered like
so many butterflies through the summer sunshine—what do we know
of their personality?</p>

<p>Several references are made in this work to the similarity which
exists between the éventaillistes and the ceramists. The conditions of
production were precisely the same, the workers in the two arts were,
broadly speaking, of the same artistic calibre; indeed, it is on record
that, upon a shortage of painters at the royal factory of Sèvres, the
éventaillistes were called in to fill the breach. At the close of the reign
of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span>, says Paul Mantz, the most prominent éventaillistes were
Chevalier, Josse, Boguet, Hébert, Race, and Mme. Vérité. Amongst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">Pg 144</a></span>
painters, almost in every instance obscure, were doubtless some young
artists who had still their position to make, and the signature of Cahaigue
is recorded with the date 1766. In the Louvre are two fan leaves signed
by Raymond La Farge, <i>c.</i> 1680. An ivory brisé fan, with the subject of
Blindman’s Buff, signed ‘Tiquet Fecit, 1720,’ appeared in the Walker sale
in 1882. Le Sieur Pichard, also, is mentioned in an almanac of 1773,
as being very well known as a fan painter; Mme. Doré, at the same
date, painted on silk and gauze: both the last-named worked for the
éventaillistes.—But the greater names, which have become illustrious in
the annals of French art, Watteau, Boucher, Fragonard; is it possible
to claim these also for the fan?—A fan bearing the ineffably gracious
touch of a Fragonard, what a possession! Lancret painted a picture in
the <i>form</i> of a fan, representing two figures in a wooded landscape. M.
Paul Mantz, referring to the fan in the collection of Dr. Poigey of
Paris, decorated with light simple ornament and medallion heads of a youth
and two young girls, says: ‘The delicacy of refined rose tint, the sureness
of touch, the free manipulation of the gouache, show a master-hand; of
a certainty, if Boucher ever painted a fan, it is this one.’</p>

<p>Balzac (<i>Cousin Pons</i>) refers to a ‘gem of a fan’ found at a secondhand
dealer’s, enclosed in a little box of West India wood, <i>signed by
Watteau</i>(?), and formerly the property of La Pompadour. The old
musician turns towards his cousin with a courtly bow, offers her the fan
of the favourite, saying: ‘It is time for that which has served Vice to
be in the hands of Virtue; a hundred years will be required to work
such a miracle. Be sure that no princess can have anything comparable
with this <i>chef d’œuvre</i>, for it is unhappily in human nature to do more
for a Pompadour than for a virtuous Queen.’</p>

<p>We learn from Brantôme that Catherine de’ Medicis, who made
her first public entry into Paris as queen in 1549, introduced into the
French court the Italian feather-fans, in general use in Italy at that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">Pg 145</a></span>period; these being made and sold by the perfumers who came in the
queen’s retinue. In a half-length engraved portrait in the British Museum,
the queen bears a plumed fan with an elaborately ornamented handle
garnished with pearls; in another portrait, a plumed fan with a mirror
in the centre. Brantôme records that, upon the untimely death of
the king, her husband, Catherine caused to be put round her device<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>
broken fans, with the feathers falling to pieces and the mirror
cracked;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> this in token of having abandoned worldly frivolities. In a
small oval engraved portrait in the British Museum collection, this
broken fan motif is introduced as forming a diapered border; the fans
alternated with twisted cords and scythes.</p>

<p>It is not until the reign of Henry <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, that we find the first authentic
evidence of the use of l’éventail plissé; fans were then much in fashion,
and, says Henri Estienne, ‘were held so much in esteem, that, now the
winter is come, the ladies cannot give them up, but having used them
in summer to cool themselves against the heat of the sun, they make
them serve in winter against the heat of the fire.’<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>Pierre de l’Estoile, in his <i>Isle des Hermaphrodites</i>, 1588, gives
us a detailed account of the fan used by this effeminate monarch,
evidently some form of cockade, ‘expanding and folding merely by a
turn of the fingers.’ It was sufficiently large to be used also as a
parasol, and served therefore the double purpose of cooling the air, and
preserving the delicate complexion of the king.</p>

<p>The material was vellum, cut as delicately as possible, with lace
around of similar stuff.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> ‘I could see in the other chambers,’ continues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">Pg 146</a></span>this author, ‘fans of the same material, or of taffetas, with borders of
gold and silver lace.’</p>

<p>This art of elaborate cutting, in vellum, paper, and other material,
was, as a matter of fact, a favourite pastime of the period; it is said to
have been indulged in by the king himself, and it may be taken that this
method of <i>découpé</i>, or <i>découpé</i> in association with other forms of
ornamentation, was employed in a large number of the fans of this
epoch, both of the cockade and semicircular form.</p>

<p>Of this latter type, now beginning to be the vogue, the Actæon
fan in the Musée de Cluny is one of the earliest known examples. The
leaf is of parchment, cut in a series of slits through which the ten
sticks, shaped to an ornamental profile, are inserted. The vellum around
the sticks is painted to the shape of arrows; the spaces between are cut
away, to allow of the insertion of strips of mica, upon which are painted
devices representing Actæon, his hounds, a stag, a swan, etc. The general
character of the ornamentation is that of the earlier French Renaissance;
the date, <i>c.</i> 1580.</p>

<p>The fan industry in France had become of such importance under
Henry <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>, that it was necessary to regulate it by statute; certain
concessions were therefore granted in December 1594 to the several bodies
of craftsmen engaged in the art of fan-making. These were confirmed,
and fresh regulations added, towards 1664.</p>

<p>On a petition presented to Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span> in 1673 by the master fan-makers
to the number of sixty, they were constituted a corporate body
by the edict of March 23rd of that year, and their privileges further
strengthened by edicts of December 1676 and January and February 1678.
These ordained that the company should be ruled by four jurors, two of
whom were re-nominated every year in September in an assembly at which
every master could assist irrespectively. No one could be a master
without having served four years’ apprenticeship and having produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">Pg 147</a></span>a <i>chef-d’œuvre</i>. Nevertheless, the sons of a master were exempt from
the <i>chef-d’œuvre</i> as well as the members who married the widows or
daughters of masters. The widows enjoyed the privileges of their
departed husbands so long as they remained single. They could not,
however, engage new apprentices. The entrance fee was fixed at four
hundred livres.</p>

<p>In 1753, the period of the highest development of the industry, there
were no less than one hundred and fifty master fan-makers in Paris, and
from a rare book (<i>Journal du Citoyen</i>), published at the Hague in 1754,
we learn the prices usually obtained: Wooden fans (les éventails de
bois de palissandre), 6 to 18 livres a dozen; fans in gilt wood (bois d’or),
9 to 36 livres a dozen; those partly of wood and partly of ivory (les
maistres brins en yvoire et la gorge en os), 24 to 72 livres a dozen. Ivory
fans, 48 to 60 livres a dozen; others more elaborate sold for 30 or 40 pistoles
apiece.</p>

<p>The fan-makers were united with the wood-polishers and lute-makers
by the edict of August 11th, 1776, as was also the painting, carving, and
varnishing relative to these crafts.</p>

<p>The proportions of the folded fan have varied considerably at different
periods, in obedience to the caprices of fashion, and this, together with other
features, is a general indication as to date. An attempt is here made, by
means of a series of diagrams, to formulate, from well-authenticated
examples, a system of development; but this can only be accepted in a
general way, since during most periods, and especially during the eighteenth
century, many exceptions to this rule might be cited.</p>

<p>During the last half of the sixteenth century, doubtless, the general proportion
of the fan was that of a fourth of a circle. Alex. Fabri, 1593, gives
the costume of the French ladies of his time and of older date, and observes
that these ladies held fans of a quarter circle plissés. Vecellio, 1600, gives
fans of a similar proportion. These were both brisé and leaf; the fans of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">Pg 148</a></span>
Ferrara, decorated with mica insertion, were also of this shape. At this
same period, fans were also made of a slightly extended width, the Actæon
fan of Cluny being an example.</p>

<p>The width was gradually extended during the first half of the seventeenth
century, until, at the close of the reign of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, it had attained
almost a full semicircle, the engraved fans of Abraham Bosse being
authentic instances.</p>

<p>During the reign of the Grand Monarque the mount is deep, the
shoulder, as a consequence, low; the fan, after a slight reduction, again
opening out to a full semicircle. The blades, which in the first half of the
seventeenth century varied in France from four to eighteen, had increased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">Pg 149</a></span>by the end of the century to twenty-four or twenty-six, the number
again falling to between eighteen to twenty-one by the middle of the
succeeding century. During the reign of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span> the width of the fan
was lessened, being reduced to one-third of a circle, the shoulder being
raised about 1720, thus leaving less space for the mount, the blades numbering
eighteen to twenty-two.</p>

<p>In the succeeding reign (Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XVI.</span>) the fan once again unfolded itself
to a full semicircle; the blades were either straight and narrow, the incrustations
of a correspondingly reticent character, or very broad, showing no
space between, the decorations extremely ornate; their number in either
instance varying from twelve to sixteen or eighteen.</p>

<p>The above scale of proportion is, however, by no means absolute; we
have fans with high shoulders, and correspondingly shallow mounts during
the period of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span>; we also have, during the same period, fans which
open out only to the third of a circle.</p>

<p>The <i>size</i> of the folding-fan has also been subject to many variations.
From the period of its introduction it increased under Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span>, fluctuated
to the middle of the eighteenth century, and gradually lessened its proportions
to the period of the Revolution and First Empire.</p>

<p>In 1729 the Duc de Richelieu writes: ‘Small fans have quite gone out,
and the newest are bigger than ever. Ladies are now never without them,
summer or winter.’ From the <i>Mercure de France</i>, October 1730, we learn
that ‘Many fans are of a very considerable price and excessively large, so that
some little folks are not quite twice the height of their own fans, a circumstance
which ought to fill with a due sense of respect the light and
playful cavaliers.’ This continued during the hoop period or second
blossoming of the whalebone petticoat, when the fan, not to be outdone,
assumed similar vast proportions, and again dwindled to such an extent
that it acquired the name of ‘imperceptible.’</p>

<p>Another important consideration in determining the date of a fan is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">Pg 150</a></span>
in the fact that the sticks, being of a more enduring substance than the
mount, have often been remounted with paintings of a later date;<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> the
careful collector will, therefore, in selecting a specimen, consider the fan
in all its various characteristics—the style of the painting, and the
general character of its ornamentation.</p>

<p>Mr. S. Redgrave, in his catalogue of the fans exhibited at South
Kensington in 1870, refers to the difficulty in assigning fans to the country
to which their manufacture might be most correctly attributed: ‘Workmen
of one country have been tempted to another; Chinese carvers brought to
Europe; parts of fans in which a particular country has excelled have been
imported to another, and used with its native manufacture. In all cases,
novel taste, approved by fashion, has never failed to become the object of
universal imitation.’</p>

<p>The art of painting during the reign of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span> began to play a
more important part in the decoration of fans; the subject, in the few
examples existing of this epoch, being usually enclosed in a florid
cartouche with festoons of fruit, flowers, amorini, etc., as in the three
engraved examples by Abraham Bosse, who was working in Paris at this
period. Indeed it is extremely probable that the publication of these fans
strongly influenced the character of the decoration of fan mounts; it is
more than possible that Bosse himself painted fans, since he was painter
as well as engraver, although his pictures are extremely rare. The label,
‘Éventails de Bosse,’ appearing on the box handed by the merchant to
the lady in the engraving ‘La Galerie du Palais,’ may quite conceivably
refer to painted as well as engraved fans.</p>

<p>La Galerie du Palais, besides forming the subject of Bosse’s engraving,
supplied Corneille with the <i>motif</i> of one of his comedies produced in 1634.
‘La Galerie’ was situated in the midst of the city, beside the Palais de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">Pg 151</a></span>Justice, between the two branches of the Seine, and had become, at the close
of the reign of Henry <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>, a ‘lively and animated centre.’</p>

<p>In the latter years of the reign of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span> it was, as we learn from
the explanatory verses at the foot of Bosse’s engraving, as also from
Corneille’s comedy, a place of rendezvous for, and assignations with, the
beau-monde.</p>

<p>It was furnished with wooden shops in which were arranged <i>objets de
luxe</i>, new fashions, <i>chefs-d’œuvres</i> of industry, laces, and jewellery.</p>

<p>The engraving shows a mercer’s shop with a cavalier and lady
examining fans, these objects being also exposed to view in the window.
We have here a genuine bit of old Paris of the time of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>,
and thus obtain a clear idea of what the Paris fan shops were like at
this epoch.</p>

<p>Fans had, indeed, at this period obtained a firm hold upon the
affections of the fair, though not so firm as to preclude the possibility
of a powerful rival. The witty author of the lines appended to Bosse’s
engraving of Summer, in the circular composition of the four seasons,
a lady with a fan, accompanied by a Cupid bearing a parasol, suggests that
the love-god himself would be a better substitute for the fan, not only for
cooling the heated cheek, but also to assuage the fire that burns within.</p>

<p>Authenticated examples of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span> fans are exceedingly rare. In
the Jubinal collection at Paris is a superb fan painted on skin, representing
the king playing blind-man’s buff with the four quarters of the globe.
This is designed upon the same principle as the three engraved fans of
Bosse above referred to, <i>i.e.</i> the subject enclosed in a large and elaborate
cartouche, filling the whole field of the fan, a system of decoration which
lasted well into the reign of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span></p>

<p>The Countess de Beaussier exhibited at South Kensington, in 1870, a
mount of vellum painted with a large medallion or cartouche in the centre,
of lords and ladies of the court of France joining in a dance in a park,
the border enriched with coloured ornament in the style of the period.</p>

<p>During the earlier part of the reign of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, Anne of Austria,
his queen, introduced many Spanish fashions into France, amongst them
being fans.</p>

<p>It is recorded of this princess that, during a conference with Richelieu,
some kittens amused themselves with the ribbons of her fan which had
been left on a table in the antechamber; from this circumstance the ribbons
acquired the name of Badins (playful).<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>It was from a similar light incident that, later, at the time of the
unpopularity of Mazarin, the fan became a means of expressing political
intrigue. Straw was adopted as the rallying sign of the Frondeurs, who,
after the victory in Paris, wore it in their hats and button-holes.</p>

<p>A great crowd was applauding the king and princess in the great
allée, and crying out against Mazarin. Mademoiselle had appeared holding
a fan as she walked, to which was attached a bouquet of straw bound with
blue ribbon.</p>

<p>Straw also formed part of the decoration of fans, both at this period
and later. The pattern of leaves, flowers, fruits, or conventional ornament,
was cut in various coloured straws and <i>applied</i>. The handsome fan in
the possession of Lady Bristol, with the subject of Hector and Andromache,
after Antoine Coypel, belonging, however, to a later period, is decorated
at the sides with coloured straw-work. This material was even employed
in the decoration of the stick in the form of inlay upon ivory and other
substance; an example occurs in the collection of Mr. L. C. R. Messel.
This also of a much later period.</p>

<p>D’Alembert, in his <i>Réflexions et Anecdotes sur la Reine de Suède</i>,
recounts how the irascible, fierce, and railing daughter of Gustavus
Adolphus found herself at the court of Louis XIV., when the fashion of
fans was general (1656-1657). Consulted by a fair Frenchwoman as to
whether she should ply her fan even during the winds of winter, Christina
replied that the lady might fan herself or not, as she pleased; either way
she would be a straw blown about by the wind. Upon this, the court
dames, nettled at the rude reply of the haughty mistress of Monaldeschi,
one and all armed themselves with fans, and waved them furiously whenever
the queen was present, by way of exhibiting a wholesome French
contempt for northern barbarism.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">Pg 154</a></span></p>
<p>This circumstance led to the adoption of fans of a richer and more
ornate description. Fashion hastened to make the toy worthy of figuring in
grand adornment; the ordinary wood of the stick was replaced by other
supports of a more precious material, with incrustations of gold, silver,
enamel, and jewels. More capable artists were employed for the execution
of the mounts; the éventaillistes learnt from the Italians to derive their
inspiration from the great masters of their school. The decoration of
the fan-leaves, therefore, acquired something of the suavity, graciousness,
and courtliness associated with the work of the painters of the Grand Siècle.</p>

<p>It was, doubtless, some such fan, some enchanting reminiscence of
the dainty ‘putti’ of Poussin, that Madame de Sévigné sent to her
daughter, Madame de Grignan.—‘The Chevalier de Buous brings you a
fan, which I think very pretty: they are not little loves upon it, for
without doubt they are little chimney-sweeps, the most charming little
sweeps in the world.’<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>Two fans are known of the beginning of the reign of the Grand
Monarque. One, of which only the feuille is preserved, is in the possession
of Mr. J. G. Rosenberg, of Karlsruhe, the other in the Schreiber collection,
British Museum. The former is painted in gouache on swan skin, and
represents the signing of the marriage contract between Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span> and
Maria Theresa, which event took place at St. Jean de Luz on the Spanish
frontier in 1660. The king and queen are seated before a table in the
centre, the courtiers standing in a semicircle, the men in their fur-trimmed
robes, the ladies all bearing fans; an official in the foreground
is reading aloud the marriage contract. The pattern of the carpet is seized
upon as a decorative <i>motif</i>, and forms a diapered groundwork to the
composition after the manner of the earlier miniaturists. This truly
magnificent mount betrays no evidence of the Italian influence; no
suggestion of ‘le premier peintre du Roi,’<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> but entirely reminiscent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">Pg 155</a></span>of the great traditional French style. It is, moreover, an original production,
rather than, as is the case of so many fan leaves, a mere transcription
of the work of the greater artists.</p>

<p>In the Schreiber fan leaf, the king and queen are seated under a
canopy, a Cupid above bearing a rose garland and palm branch. The
ladies of the court, all holding fans, are seated around in a semicircle, and
on the right Cupids prepare the nuptial couch. This leaf, which has been
much repainted, is in gouache on paper, with gilding in places; it has been
removed from the mount and pasted on an oak panel.</p>

<p>On a later fan, the king is represented as Phœbus descending from
his chariot, holding in his hand the mirror of truth to the assembled
court beauties, on whose countenances fear, alarm, and doubt appear. A
figure on the right (Louise de la Vallière) opens her arms eagerly to
receive him.</p>

<p>The king also appears as Endymion sleeping on Mount Latmos.
La Vallière, in the character of Diana, is alighting from her chariot and
contemplating the beautiful shepherd. A figure of Spring scatters flowers.
In the background two attendants of the goddess; <i>c.</i> 1660.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Walker in his sale catalogue (1882) suggests that these two
fans, the sticks of which have perished and have been replaced by those of
old English workmanship, were painted for the Duchess de la Vallière
in the early time of her attendance at the court of Anne of Austria. She
is said to have formed a real and virtuous attachment to the king.</p>

<p>A fan mount in the Schreiber collection, also belonging to the earlier
years of the reign of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span>, has for its subject the ‘Lovers’ Agency
Bureau.’ In the midst of a semicircular temple, on an island surrounded
by a flowered border, is a golden statue of Cupid seated upon a globe,
bearing a banner inscribed, ‘L’Amour Avec ces traits Veut blesser tout
Le monde. Je Reigne dans les sieux Sur la terre et Sur londe.’ Cupids
are seated at a table covered with green cloth, serving amorous couples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">Pg 156</a></span>
with tablets inscribed, ‘Congé Pour Un Amant Constant: Congé Pour
Un Fidelle’; ‘Congé pour La Belle Iris.’ In front of the table a Cupid
is seated on a large crimson cushion, holding a scroll inscribed, ‘Le
Directeur Du Bureau D’amour.’ Two figures are kneeling at the end
of the table, the one holding a purse, the other a scroll inscribed, ‘Contract
De Constitution De Rente.’ In the foreground on either side are couples
who have married for money—a young man holding a purse is accompanied
by an elderly woman, and an old man who supports himself on
a crutch, accompanied by a young woman, is carrying a box labelled
‘Bijouteri’; in both instances a Cupid follows them with a rod for punishment.
Around the island are moored ships with banners inscribed, ‘Vous
qui cherchez D’un Amoureux Desir,’ etc.</p>

<p>The fan leaf has been pasted on an oval panel and repainted to complete
the shape.</p>

<p>The fine varnish, celebrated in the verse of Voltaire,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> which has
become associated with the name of Martin, was not, properly speaking,
a new invention, but rather a fresh application of an old method.
Attempts had been made during the reign of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span> to imitate the
lacquers of Japan, and the process was first applied to furniture. In an
inventory of the effects of Molière we read of a ‘small cabinet with
Chinese varnish,’ and of ‘two dice-boxes of wood, varnished after the
Chinese fashion.’ This was the period when the artistic products of
the East were so much exercising the minds of European craftsmen,
as a consequence of the opening up of China and Japan to western
traders.</p>

<p>The four brothers Martin, William, Simon-Étienne, Julien, and
Robert, coach-painters, sons of a tailor of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, in
applying themselves to the task of imitating the processes of Oriental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">Pg 157</a></span>lacquer, by a fortunate accident developed a method admirably suited to
the decoration of fans, which, in spite of many attempts to imitate, has
never since been rivalled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p>Two concessions were obtained—those of November 27, 1730, and
February 18, 1744, permitting the elder Martin, for the space of twenty
years, to execute all sorts of works in relief after the manner of the
Chinese and Japanese.</p>

<p>An advertisement in <i>Le Mercure</i>, which appeared during the year
1724, recommends to the curious the fine productions in Chinese and
Japanese varnish, of this ‘excellent and unique craftsman who imitates
and often surpasses his models.’<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> In 1732 a fresh announcement is
made in the same journal to the effect that ‘Le Sieur Martin the elder,
who may be said to have considerably enriched the beaux-arts in Europe
by imitating and even surpassing in many respects the beautiful varnishes
and reliefs of China and Japan, gives notice to the public that he undertakes
panels, friezes, ceilings, carriages, etc., in splendid varnishings.’</p>

<p>This varnish, with its brilliant translucency, and its remarkable immunity
from cracking, was applied over painting done in the ordinary
oil method, the painting being necessarily thin, almost to transparency,
the material of the fan usually ivory. The decoration consists of either
a single subject covering the whole field of the fan, or a system of one,
three, or many cartouches, occasionally as many as twenty miniatures,
enclosed in an ornamental setting, made up of a curious mixture of
Chinese diapered patterns, semi-naturalistic semi-Persian ornament,
Italian arabesques, and French ornament of the character with which we
are familiar in Rouen ware.</p>

<p>The guards are in most instances decorated with miniatures, usually
two superior and two inferior, divided by ornamental borders or</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">Pg 158</a></span></p>
<p>arabesques. On the handle end of the fan, <i>i.e.</i> the smaller semicircle,
are either one, three, or more miniatures, often imitation Chinese subjects:
these, in some instances, are in self-colour, as pink, red, or blue. The
gilding is both in leaf and painted, usually worked over with a pattern
in red or brown.</p>

<p>The figure-painting is in no instance by a master-hand, <i>i.e.</i> by an
artist of the first calibre, but by skilled workmen, or artificers, deriving
their inspiration from outside sources.</p>

<p>The subjects with which these fans were decorated embrace every
class. Thus we have representations of ancient history, both sacred and
profane, subjects which recorded important current events, subjects fanciful
of almost every description.</p>

<p>That of the ‘Rape of Helen’ occurs often; the fine fan in the possession
of Mr. J. G. Rosenberg of Karlsruhe has this subject for its principal
medallion, the style recalling Le Brun, with sixteen smaller subjects from
classic mythology, these divided by a gold band. Also in the beautiful
example in the possession of Lady Lindsay this same subject is treated,
though in a very different manner. (Illustrated facing p. 30.)</p>

<p>In the cabinet of Madame Riant is the ‘Judgment of Paris,’
the subject <i>en cartouche</i>, with smaller cartouches in the Chinese
taste.</p>

<p>Probably one of the earliest of these ‘Vernis Martin’ fans (ivory brisé
fans had been painted earlier, during the latter part of the seventeenth century)
is the bridal-fan of the Duchess of Burgundy, Adelaide of Savoy,
mother of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span> The subject represents the fêtes at Versailles on the
occasion of the marriage of the grandson of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span> in 1709. On the
obverse the bride appears seated upon a dais with attendants bearing floral
offerings. In the centre the king dances a minuet with Madame de
Maintenon, ‘ma tante,’ as the dauphin endearingly called her. Other
dancing figures, musicians, etc., complete the composition, which is en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">Pg 159</a></span>closed
in a large cartouche of fruits, masks, instruments, etc.; on the field
of the fan are representations of country life.</p>

</tr></table></div>

<p>On the lower semicircle, <i>en cartouche</i>, the bride again appears
playing a guitar, the remaining space being occupied by subjects of a
Chinese character. On the reverse we have a representation of the fêtes
in the palace gardens, with scenes from the life of the prince—as pupil
of Fénelon, and as lover; miniatures of the prince and princess appear on
the panaches. This important fan has been attributed to the pencil of
Watteau, but with small grounds, being quite unlike the character of
Watteau’s work except in the type of some of the figures represented.</p>

<p>The example which formed part of the royal collection at Windsor
Castle is so well known that it scarcely needs description here. It consists
of a large number of cartouches of classical and pastoral subjects
divided by gold borderings. It formerly belonged to Marie-Antoinette,
and was procured for Her Majesty Queen Victoria by the Queen of
the Belgians.</p>

<p>The fan representing the ‘Toilette of Madame la Marquise de
Montespan,’ and ‘the Promenade,’ in the possession of the Countess
Duchâtel, has become historic. It was sent by Madame de Sévigné
to her daughter, Madame de Grignan, and is thus referred to in her 149th
letter: ‘My fan has then become most useful, doubtless. Do you not
think it beautiful? Alas, what a bagatelle! You would not take away
from me this small pleasure when occasion presents itself—you would
thank me for that pleasure, although it is a mere nothing.’</p>

<p>We are enabled, by the courtesy of Mr. Leopold de Rothschild, to
illustrate (facing p. 142) one of the best-preserved examples of this interesting
type of fan. The subject represents a company of musicians in a
garden, with trellised background and fountain; on the lower cartouche a
classical landscape; on the panaches are figures of Harlequin, Pierrot, etc.,
the ornamental portions being painted with the most minute finish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">Pg 160</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the death of the elder Martin in 1749, his widow associated
herself with her brother-in-law, Julien Martin, who was acquainted with
the secrets of this varnish and method. The studio at the entrance to
the Faubourg Saint-Denis, therefore, did not cease to prosper, and production
went on until 1758. This at least we learn of the engraver
Pasquier, and it seems to us that the most successful varnishes are the
earliest in date—those which appear to have been produced 1720-1745.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>The foregoing quotation refers to Martin’s productions generally,
but is equally applicable to the fan, and it is probable that although a
few isolated examples of these delicate objects may have been produced
during the latter years of the reign of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span>, production did not
become very general until later in the lifetime of Martin the elder, who
subsequently received the title of ‘Vernisseur du roi.’</p>

<p>The question as to whether the brothers Martin themselves painted
their fans, or to what extent they were indebted to outside assistance,
opens up an interesting field of inquiry. The order of their production,
also, presents considerable difficulties. In some cases, as that of the bridal-fan
of the Duke of Burgundy, the event itself determines the date; in the
majority of instances, however, the subject affords no clue, and any conclusions
formed are necessarily more or less speculative and problematical.
The natural order of decorative development is from simplicity to complexity
in both arrangement and detail; it is therefore reasonable to assume that
the earlier examples are those displaying a certain severity and reticence
of style and method, and a simple arrangement of either one or but few
subjects, and that the later fans are those exhibiting a profusion of
medallions of various sizes, divided by gold bands. The variety in the
style, manner, and handling, of the subjects depicted on these fans, to say
nothing of the number extant, of itself disposes of the theory that they
were all the work of the brothers, but in any case they must be credited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">Pg 161</a></span>with the original conception of a style and method of decoration which,
although it will scarcely bear searching analysis if judged from the standpoint
of strict decorative principles, is fresh, piquant, and unique.</p>

<p>To return to pleated fans. In the Franks collection appeared an
example with the leaf of paper finely painted in gouache, with the betrothal
of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span> with Marie Leczinska, and on the reverse a pastoral scene.
The brins and panaches are of white pearl, richly ornamented with
carved medallions of figures, portraits, heraldry, and scroll-work in
different coloured gold foils. This fan belonged to Marie, queen of
Louis XV.</p>

<p>The bridal-fan of Marie Leczinska has a skin mount, the subject
representing the king and his bride elect, attended by Cardinal Fleury
in lay habit, bringing offerings of flowers to the altar of Hymen; a dog
(emblem of fidelity) sits beside the king. In the foreground on either
side are groups in rural character; on the reverse, which is of paper, is
a pastorelle in which the royal couple again appear. The brins and
panaches are of mother-of-pearl, richly carved with a centre medallion
representing the queen as Venus descending from her chariot, receiving
the homage of Mars. Cupids, heraldic devices, fleurs de lys, and
a small medallion of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span> complete the design, which is enriched
with variegated gilding.</p>

<p>The symbolical marriage of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span> with Marie Leczinska on
Mount Olympus is depicted on a fine mount of vellum in the possession of
M. Voisin, with portraits of the king and princess surrounded by Genii;
figures of Jupiter, Juno, and Apollo <i>en cartouche</i>, musicians, etc., in rose
camaïeu, surrounded by the arms of France and Poland; the reverse, a
figure subject in blue camaïeu on silver ground. Stick, ‘Vernis Martin’
on ivory; guards, incrustations of mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>The fan in the collection of the Dowager-Marchioness of Bristol refers
to the improvements made in Paris during the reign of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span>; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">Pg 162</a></span>
shows in the distance the fine square (Place de Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span>) which adjoined
the Palace of the Tuileries, with the bronze equestrian statue of the
king on a pedestal supported by four statues representing Strength,
Peace, Prudence, and Justice. The group, destroyed during the Revolution,
gave occasion to the following epigram:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
‘O la belle Statue! O le beau piédestal!</div>
<div class="line">Les vertus sont à pied, le vice est à cheval!’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The king, attended by Minerva, who holds her ægis over his head, is giving
directions as to the building to a kneeling figure whose cloak and shield are
ornamented with the fleurs de lys of France. A seated winged genius is
holding a large open book, Cupids are playing musical instruments and
supporting a trophy of arms and a medallion portrait of Louis XIV.
The square will remain for ever memorable as the scene of the execution of
Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XVI.</span> It was renamed Place de la Révolution.</p>

<p>The stick is of ivory, carved with allegorical subjects, variegated gold
enrichments, the imbricated ornament painted blue, the guards inlaid with
mother-of-pearl; on the reverse a tent, with soldiers drinking and smoking
at a table. Jewelled pin.</p>

<p>Of the fans referring to the courtship and marriage of the dauphin (son
of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span>) we have the royal courtships in two medallions on either
side of the sun in full splendour (emblem of the king), decorated with
spangles; the mount of skin, the stick ivory, carved in open work with
appropriate figures.</p>

<p>In the centre cartouche of another fan, similar in treatment and
evidently by the same hand, the dauphin and dauphine bring floral
offerings to Hymen, the field of the fan being occupied by two smaller
medallions of Cupids, miniatures of the royal pair, and marriage emblems
at intervals, the cartouches connected by spangles; the stick ivory, carved
in open work with figures emblematic of the marriage.</p>

<p>The marriage of the dauphin with Maria Theresa of Spain (1745), or his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">Pg 163</a></span>second wife, Princess Maria Josephe de Saxe, is recorded on a magnificent
mount representing the interior of a chapel, with the bride and bridegroom
on a raised dais, a cardinal performing the ceremony. These three fans
appeared in the Walker sale of 1882.</p>

<p>The Battoir fan (illustrated facing p. 154) would appear to refer to this
Spanish marriage; it is certainly a marriage fan. The feuille of paper is
decorated with eight variously shaped medallions. In the centre the bride,
who bears a sufficient resemblance to the engraved portraits of Maria Theresa,
is taking tea; also a heart-shaped composition with two figures kneeling at
the altar of Love, Father Time in the distance; a lover offering a bouquet
to a lady, etc. The admirably designed stick and guards are of ivory,
carved and gilt, decorated with emblematic figures, amorini, trophies of
musical instruments, etc., bearing the fleurs de lys of France and the arms
of Spain.</p>

<p>The magnificent fan in the possession of Mrs. Bischoffsheim reflects
the general interest taken in the classics during the earlier part of the
eighteenth century. Dryden’s English translation of Virgil was given
to the world in 1697, and the Latin edition of P. Masvicius, Leovardiae,
1717, contained the commentaries of Servius, Philargyrius, and Pierius.
The fan belongs to the earlier years of the reign of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span>, and
illustrates the story unfolded in the first book of the <i>Æneid</i>. On the
reverse the storm raised by Æolus at the bidding of Juno, a rock in the
foreground being inscribed ‘Naufrage d’Énée’: and the meeting of Venus
and Æneas. On the obverse the banquet:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The so-called ‘Cabriolet’ fan, introduced during the reign of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span>,
represents a new and interesting development. In this the mount is
divided into two parts, superior and inferior, the latter being half-way up
the stick, the former in its usual place at the top; the intervening space
imparting a lightness and richness to the fan not obtainable by other
means, the mount still affording a sufficiency of space for decoration on a
less extended scale. This usually consists of Parisian scenes—persons
driving in cabriolets, or promenading, either painted or engraved as the
case may be, since both processes were adopted.</p>

<p>The cabriolet, introduced by Josiah Child in 1755, was a light two-wheeled
carriage which obtained great popularity in Paris. Horace
Walpole, writing to his friend Mann in the same year, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘All we hear from France is, that a new madcap reigns there, as strong as that
of Pantins was.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> This is <i>la fureur de cabriolets</i>, Anglicè one-horse chairs, a mode
introduced by Mr. Child. Everything is to be <i>en cabriolet</i>; the men paint them on
their waistcoats, have them embroidered for clocks to their stockings, and the women,
who have gone all the winter without anything on their heads, are now muffled up in
great caps, with round sides, in the form of, and scarce less than, the wheels of
chaises.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Two varieties of these rare fans appear in different collections; a
larger and richer fan measuring some twenty inches and opening out to
a little more than a third of a circle, the sticks numbering twenty-one,
including the panaches; another about an inch smaller, with less carving
on the sticks, and made at a later date.</p>

<p>The fine example illustrated from the collection of Lady Bristol
has nine cabriolets, two on the larger and three on the smaller paper
mounts, two on the brins, and two on the panaches. The upper portion
of the ivory stick is carved with three series of three figures enclosed in
an ornamental setting, and one on each panache, with ‘goldfish’ inlay.
The lower portion has two large cartouches of figure subjects also with
‘goldfish’ inlay, and a smaller one painted, the whole of the stick
elaborately painted and gilt. A similar fan is in the possession of the
Comtesse de Chambrun, Paris, and was exhibited at South Kensington
in 1870.</p>

<p>Two examples of the smaller variety are given from the collections
of Lady Northcliffe and Lady Bristol, similar in general character, but
presenting slight differences in detail. On each of these fans only one
cabriolet appears, painted decoration taking the place of the rich carving
and gilding on the stick of the larger fan.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the reign of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span> the fan industry suffered
a temporary relapse: the fashion for the cheaper printed fans, and also
for the importations from the East, spread even to the aristocrats. We read
of a fashionable jeweller at this period undertaking to supply to La
Pompadour a dozen fans direct from Nankin for the insignificant sum
of seventy-two livres. An interesting design for a fan in the Hennin
collection (Bibliothèque Nationale) is probably intended as an effort to
revive interest in the more expensive fans,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> and is inscribed, ‘Combat
du terrible torreau représenté par des enfants en présence de Sa Majesté
Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span>, roi de France et de Navarre.’ This was a spectacle devised
for the king’s amusement in 1760. In an enclosure, a bull-fight, in
which the actors are children, is taking place before a large concourse of
spectators, including the king and queen; on the left are trumpeters and
other figures, on the right is a figure holding three hounds in leash.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">Pg 166</a></span></p>
<p>La Pompadour is glorified on a skin mount in the collection of Mrs.
Bruce Johnston; the subject being ‘hommages’ offered by Church, State,
Literature, Art and Music at the altar of madame, who appears as Venus
seated on a raised throne in the centre of the composition, her car and doves
in the background. A Cupid strikes at her bosom with his arrow, others
dance to the music of a mandoline, while another, crowned with a laurel
wreath, rides on the back of the French Eagle. This was probably
painted by one of the numerous artists employed by madame, and
never mounted. (Illustrated facing p. 6.)</p>

<p>The story of Rinaldo and Armida supplied the subject of many
fans produced during the century. Handel’s opera <i>Rinaldo</i> was first
produced in London, February 24, 1711. It was staged in the most
sumptuous manner, the gardens of Armida being filled with live birds, a
piece of stage realism hardly to be surpassed even in these days: it had,
however, little vogue on the Continent. Gluck’s <i>Armide</i>, which appeared
in 1777, fared better, the composer being then in the height of his
popularity, and, moreover, under the powerful protection of his former
pupil, Marie-Antoinette, who, upon the success of <i>Orphée</i>, granted him
a pension of six thousand francs, and a like sum for every fresh work
he should produce on the French stage.</p>

<p>The charming fan, here illustrated, by the gracious permission of
H.R.H. the Princess of Wales, is anterior to the date of the production
of Gluck’s opera, and is one of the best of the numerous versions of
the subject. It was given by King William IV. to Augusta, Duchess of
Cambridge, and left by her to her granddaughter, Victoria Mary, Princess
of Wales. (Frontispiece.)</p>

<p>In Miss Moss’s fan, also illustrated, the stick is of ivory carved <i>à jour</i>,
and painted with a cartouche in the centre, of Neptune, Venus, and Cupid.</p>

<p>The fêtes given on the occasion of the marriage of the young
dauphin, afterwards Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XVI.</span>, with Marie-Antoinette, are recorded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">Pg 167</a></span>on a fan in the Wyatt collection, in the centre of which are shown the
illuminations with fireworks, a scroll inscribed, ‘Vive la France, l’empire,
et tous leurs alliés à jamais’; above is inscribed, ‘Feu d’artifice de Mr.
L’ambassadeur Exécuté le 10 Juin 1770 par le Sr. Torre Artificier du
Roi.’ On the left is a street scene with a band of musicians and spectators;
on the right, four figures viewing the illuminations. A cartouche on the
right is inscribed, ‘Fêtes Publiques à l’occasion du mariage de Mr. le
Dauphin.’ The mount is of paper, the stick and guards ivory, pierced
gilt, and inlaid with mother-of-pearl. (Illustrated facing p. 180.)</p>

<p>An allegory of this marriage appears as the subject of a fan that
formed part of an important collection of a deceased Parisian lady,
Madame X., sold at the Hôtel Drouot, April 1897. In this the stick is
mother-of-pearl, carved with reliefs, gilt, and the arms of France and
Austria. The leaf is in gouache on skin, with medallions of the royal
pair, alternated with others emblematic of the Fine Arts.</p>

<p>Another bridal-fan of Marie-Antoinette has on the obverse an allegorical
composition, in which the dauphine, enthroned upon a cloud, is
about to sign the marriage contract which Cupid lays before her,
while Hymen hovers above: on the left, the Graces weave garlands of
roses; on the right, Midas and Discordia are banished to the regions of
obscurity.</p>

<p>On the reverse, Louis and his young bride appear walking in a
wood, guided by Cupid, blind, and bearing a torch. Both these subjects
have been attributed to Fragonard; they are, however, most certainly
by two different hands. The stick is mother-of-pearl, carved <i>à jour</i>,
with figures of the royal couple, cupids, and other appropriate emblems.</p>

<p>The custom of presenting fans on the occasion of a wedding was
universal, and surely no more acceptable offering than a fan could be
made to a bride. The fine fan, illustrated by the kindness of the
Countess of Bradford, is typical of a whole class of fans produced during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">Pg 168</a></span>
the latter years of the reign of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XVI.</span>, having silk mounts, with
painted medallions, usually one superior, and the other inferior; the
borders and intervening spaces decorated with spangles of gold, silver,
and colours; the sticks either broad and ornate as in the example given,
or narrow; the ornamentation being of a more reticent character.</p>

<p>The principal medallion figures the prospective bride and bridegroom
nursing a figure of Love. On the extremely ornate mother-of-pearl stick,
lavishly gilt in dead and burnished gold of two colours, the happy
pair again appear clasping hands before the altar of Hymen, with an
accompaniment of Cupids; on the two inferior cartouches are dancing
figures with wreaths, spangling being applied here as on the leaf. The
fan appeared at the recent exhibition of Fair Women at the Grafton
Galleries, where it attracted much attention.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the birth of the dauphin, (Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XVII.</span>) in 1785,
eleven years after the marriage, the royal pair renew their vows at the
altar of Hymen. This on a fan from the unfortunate queen’s collection,
which, together with the last mentioned, appeared at the Walker sale
in 1882; the mount skin, the stick mother-of-pearl, carved in open with
portraits of the queen and the young dauphin.</p>

<p>The fan (brisé) presented by the town of Dieppe to Marie-Antoinette,
in celebration of the same event,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> is declared by Balzac to be the handsomest
of all historical fans. It is of ivory open work, carved by the
famous worker Le Flamand, eulogised by Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. The
subject, from the design for Vien, premier peintre to Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XVI.</span>, is an
episode in the life of Alexander the Great. Porus, an Indian prince, on
the eastern bank of the Hydaspes, refused to submit to Alexander, but,
defeated and taken prisoner, he was brought into the presence of the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">Pg 169</a></span>queror.
Asked how he expected to be treated, he boldly replied, ‘As a
brave man and a king.’ Alexander, subdued by his foe’s firmness, restored
to him his conquered territory.</p>

<p>When the queen was obliged to quit Versailles in 1789, she gave
this fan to Madame du Cray, who was keeper of her Majesty’s laces.
From Madame du Cray it passed into the possession of her daughter,
Madame la Bruyère, who, at her death, bequeathed it to Monsieur de
Thiac, by whom it was exhibited at South Kensington in 1870.</p>

<p>The ivory stick—the mount has long since perished, if it ever possessed
one—acquired by the Louvre, and formerly in the collection Revoil,
in 1828, is said to have been once the property of Marie-Antoinette. The
brins carved are with a subject of the king, with the two royal princes on
his right hand, receiving a deputation of ministers, the whole enclosed
within a florid and meandering cartouche, the background and diapers
<i>à jour</i>. On the panaches appear figures of Louis and Marie-Antoinette,
above their heads two genii bear the royal crown; on the gorge are
medallions of Cupids, with tragic and comic masks.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have two typical examples of the ivory work of the
last quarter of the eighteenth century, the best, presumably, that the
epoch could produce, since both were executed for the queen.</p>

<p>The last named, last also in the order of production, although it
carries picturesque richness of effect to its utmost possible limit,
nevertheless represents a worn-out tradition, an art which had become
moribund, lifeless, incapable of any fresh effort, repeating the same
tiresome platitudes with wearing and monotonous persistency; the
former, on the other hand, indicative of the commencement of that
regeneration of French art, which, inaugurated by Vien, ultimately
resulted in the creation of a school of painting and design, finding, in
the vitality of its poetic invention, no parallel in modern Europe, and
making its influence felt even to the present day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">Pg 170</a></span></p>

<p>The reign of Spartan simplicity of dress commenced early, and was
brought about by several causes, the first being the visit to Paris of
the American deputies, headed by Benjamin Franklin, 1776-78. Thus
Count de Ségur in his ‘Memoirs’: ‘It was as if the sages of Greece and
Rome had suddenly appeared; their antique simplicity of dress, their firm
and plain demeanour, their free and direct language, formed a contrast to
the frivolity, effeminacy, and servile refinements of the French. The tide
of fashion and nobility ran after these republicans, and ladies, lords, and
men of letters all worshipped them.’</p>

<p>Among other contributory causes was the publication of Saint-Pierre’s
novel, <i>Paul et Virginie</i>, in which the heroine is described as being attired
in a simple robe of white muslin, with plain straw hat, a picture which
instantly captivated the Parisiennes. Moreover, the classic revival which
set in about the middle of the century had gathered force, so that
by the commencement of the Revolution the time had become ripe for a
complete change. While the ladies were attired <i>à la Grec</i>, the gentlemen
cropped their hair <i>à la Romain</i>.</p>

<p>The fan followed the prevailing order of things, and affected simplicity.
During the period of the Directoire, and the Empire which
succeeded, the painted mounts gradually disappeared, their place being
taken by those of silk of various colours, ornamented with spangles and
similar devices.</p>

<p>The mount of Miss Ethel Birdwood’s fan, an excellent example of
the simple type, is most certainly French, obtained in France by the
grandparents of Sir George, who were expelled Huguenots, and sent out
by them to Canton to be mounted. The stick is admirably in keeping
with the reticent character of the mount, and exhibits no trace of the
characteristic Oriental vice of excess in ornamental detail.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that a system of decoration so easy of application,
and at the same time so effective as spangling, should have an extended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">Pg 171</a></span>vogue. The device was first introduced as a framework to pictures or
miniatures <i>en cartouche</i>, and as emphasising the leading lines of a
design. Gradually a more lavish use of these glistening ornaments was
made, until, during the Directoire and Empire periods, spangling formed
the chief decorative <i>motif</i> of the design; figures being treated with
spangled draperies, the flesh painted. In the Directoire fan illustrated,
with Ceres in a chariot drawn by two bullocks, spangling is carried to its
utmost limit, the whole subject, figures, animals, chariot, and accessories,
being treated with these little gold and silver discs of varying sizes.</p>

<p>This refers to the Fête de l’Agriculture celebrated by the administration
of the department of the Seine 10 messidor an VI. (28 June 1798).
A lavishly ornamented car drawn by six bullocks, their hoofs and horns
gilded, the whole decorated with wreaths of flowers, was accompanied by
the Free Trade Society of Agriculture, and the administrators of the
Natural History Museum and Veterinary School, carrying agricultural
implements, surmounted by a sheaf of corn, over which floated the
oriflamme of France; their destination being the Temple dedicated to
Cybele in the middle of the grand square of the Champs Élysées.</p>

<p>The ancient form of the chariot, says Blondel, the groups of
stationary guards with entwined arms, indicating thereby that those
around cultivate and defend the fields, serve equally to represent agriculture
to the imagination and the ancient fêtes that fertile Phrygia celebrated
in honour of the goddess of Harvests at the foot of Mount Ida. The
event was commemorated on a number of fans, both painted in gouache
and printed; Blondel figures one in the possession of the heir of Madame
Tallien, printed and coloured by hand, erroneously supposing it to refer
to this event;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> in this instance also, as in the example illustrated facing
p. 136, two bullocks only are represented.</p>

<p>This glorification of Ceres and Cybele led to the general adoption
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">Pg 172</a></span>of straw for the various articles of costume, following an older fashion.
‘There is nothing but straw in the impoverished dresses of the ladies,’
exclaim MM. de Goncourt in their <i>Société Française pendant le
Directoire</i>, echoing a curious vaudeville of the period, ‘mob caps of straw,
bonnets of straw, fans of straw, and spangles—nothing is made without
spangles.’</p>

<p>In the ‘Sans Gêne’ fan, with figure of an opera dancer, the dress of
the lady is pink gauze. The material of the leaf (green silk) is cut away,
leaving the dress semi-transparent in those parts which are not overlaid
with spangles.</p>

<p>During the Empire period and later, this system of the introduction
of gauze or net was carried further, fans being treated with a broad
border of net, and various applied decorations in gold, silver, and spangles,
these being the precursors of the fans made entirely of gauze or net,
decorated in a similar manner, and in vogue during the first quarter of
the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Lorgnette or opera-glass fans are evidence of a fashion that obtained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">Pg 173</a></span>during the seventeenth and again during the latter half of the eighteenth
centuries. M. Blondel quotes from <i>Menagiana</i> as follows:—</p>

<p>‘The fans <i>à jour</i> carried by the women, when they go to Porte
Saint-Bernard to take the air on the bank of the river, are called
“lorgnettes.”’</p>

<p>A paper called <i>Nécessaire</i>, for 1759, refers to this means of satisfying
pardonable curiosity without wounding modesty. A small opera- or spy-glass
was set in the chief sticks of the fan, either at the top of the panache,
probably the earliest form, or at the rivet. In the former case the whole
of the blades were perforated, the fan when opened showing a series
of circular perforations round its upper border. The advantage of such an
arrangement will be obvious; a fair reveller might see without being seen,
and the tell-tale blush be hid. For more distant objects the opera-glass was
called into requisition, the fan used either open or closed.</p>

<p>The material was either ivory, horn, or occasionally, in the case of the
semicircular folding-fans, gauze, decorated with spangles or embroidered
work.</p>

<p>The brisés were made to the semicircular shape, and also to that of
the full circle or cockade. In the latter instance the long handle was
provided with circular loops, by which the fan might be held in the same
manner as a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>The blades assume various shapes, as that of Love’s arrow, the bat’s
wing, an umbrella, a snake, a violin, and, when made of horn, were usually
decorated with ‘piqué.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">Pg 174</a></span></p>

<p>A curious and uncommon lorgnette-fan of the period of Louis XIV., in
the possession of Madame Jubinal, is entirely of ivory ‘découpé à jour,’
with appliqués in gelatine imitating mica, forming a transparency through
which roguish eyes may see and at the same time be protected as with
a curtain. A semicircular lorgnette-fan, of fine design, is seen in the hands
of Madame Devauçay, in the portrait by Ingres, collection of M. Frédéric
Reiset, painted 1806.</p>

<p>These interesting fans remained in vogue during the first quarter
of the nineteenth century and later.</p>

<p>The last stage of the fan during this foolish, frivolous, fascinating
eighteenth century was that of a gradual dwindling into nothingness.</p>

<p>Madame de Genlis, in her <i>Dictionary of Etiquette</i> (1818), remarks:
‘When women were timid and blushed, they were accustomed to carry large
fans to hide their blushes, serving at once as screen and veil: now that they
blush no longer, and are intimidated by nothing, they do not choose to hide
their faces, and therefore carry but microscopic fans (<i>éventails imperceptibles</i>).’<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>Blondel states that ‘this small degree of fashion continued under the
First Empire, when fans, still very small, were for the most part brisés or
garnished with taffalas; a few, however, were embellished with steel pearls,
like the jewels of Petit Dunkerque.’</p>

<p>We have seen how, during the period of the balloon petticoat, the fan,
like the frog in the fable, anxious to outdo his big neighbour the ox, swelled—and
swelled—and swelled. The consequences were less disastrous in the
case of the fan, which is nothing if not consistent. The small imps of the
fan tribe carried by those truly miraculous creatures the Merveilleuses,
whose costume was reduced to such exceedingly scanty proportions that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">Pg 175</a></span>a Frenchman even was moved to inquire if nudity would not have been a
gain to modesty, were in perfect keeping with the <i>tout ensemble</i>. The fan
lessened its proportions, grew more and more imperceptible as the rest of
the costume grew scantier, until, as in the example in the collection of Mr.
L. C. R. Messel, the blades measured but two and a half inches!</p>

(Used in the Marie Stuart dance.)<br /><br /></span></span>The history of the folded fan in England may,
broadly speaking, be said to date from the establishment
of the East India Company in 1600; this
event marking the commencement of that Oriental
trade which assumed such vast proportions during
the succeeding century. Isolated examples of the
pleated fan had, however, found their way into this
country earlier, these either brought by individual
traders from the East, or imported from the Continent
of Europe. We have already referred to the
remarkable instance of the pleated fan appearing
on the great seal of England, forming the crest
of Cœur de Lion; a conclusive proof that this
form of fan was at any rate known, if not in
occasional use, in this country during the Middle
Ages.</p>

<p>The plumed fan, nevertheless, held its own for a considerable period,
although it is extremely unlikely that it was much in vogue before the
reign of Henry VIII., when we are informed that ‘even young gentlemen
carried fans of feathers in their hands, which in wars our ancestors wore on
their heads.’<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> Shakespeare refers to ‘those remnants of fool and feather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">Pg 177</a></span>that they have got from France.’ So, also, Stephen Gosson, <i>Pleasant
Quips for upstart Gentlewomen</i>, 1596:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Were fannes and flappes of feathers fond</div>
<div class="line i1">To flit away the flisking flies,</div>
<div class="line">As tail of mare that hangs on ground</div>
<div class="line i1">When heat of Summer doth arise,</div>
<div class="line">The wit of women we might praise</div>
<div class="line i1 padb05">For finding out so great an ease.</div>

<div class="line i04">‘But, seeing they are still in hand,</div>
<div class="line i1">In house, in field, in church, in street,</div>
<div class="line">In summer, winter, water, land,</div>
<div class="line i1">In cold, in heate, in dry, in weet,</div>
<div class="line">I judge they are for wives such tooles</div>
<div class="line i1">As bables are for playes for fooles.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The author of <i>Quips for an upstart Courtier</i>, 1620, drawing a comparison
between the degeneracy of his time and the purer manners of an
earlier period, says: ‘<i>Then</i> our young courtiers strove to exceed one another
in vertue and in bravery; they rode not with fannes to ward their faces
from the wind.’</p>

<p>In Hall’s <i>Satires</i>, 1598, describing the dandies of his day:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Tir’d with pinn’d cuffs, and fans, and partlet stryps.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the play of <i>Lingua, or The Combat of the Tongue and the Five
Senses for Superiority</i>, 1617, the following directions are given for the
character of Phantastes at the head of the second scene of Act <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘A swart complexion’d fellow, but quicke-ey’d, in a white Satten doublet of one
fashion, green Velvet hose of another; a phantasticall hat with a plume of fethers of
severall colours, a little short Taffata cloake, a paire of Buskins cut, drawne out with
sundry coloured Ribands with Scarfes hung about him after all fashions, and of all
colours. Rings, Jewels, a <i>Fanne</i>, and in every place odde complements.’</p></blockquote>

<p>In the woodcut headings to the <i>Roxburghe Ballads</i> (<i>c.</i> 1635), both
feather- and folding-fans are shown; the frequent illustration of these
instruments testifying to the popularity of the fan at this epoch. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">Pg 178</a></span>
first appearance of the modern fan, says Fairholt, may be seen in a
print of the early part of the seventeenth century. The long handle is
still retained, and the fan, although arranged in folds, does not appear
to be capable of being folded. The fans here referred to are those seen
in the prints by Vecellio and earlier engravers, small in size, referred to
and illustrated in a previous chapter.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>It is not until the last decade of the sixteenth century that the
folded fan appears in painted portraits, one of the earliest being that of
Queen Elizabeth at Jesus College (1590), in which the Queen holds a
découpé fan of the character of that illustrated from Cluny, facing
page 109, having similar pointed edging.</p>

<p>The edges of these fans were occasionally varied to a semicircular
form, a curiously interesting example appearing in a portrait
of Elizabeth, Lady Wentworth, by Lucas de Heere, in which the leaf,
probably of vellum or parchment, is elaborately découpé; the edges
resembling a cheese-cutter in shape, the blades, apparently of ivory,
numbering seven.</p>

<p>The patterning often rivalled the finest lace, of which it was obviously
an imitation, lace also being used for fan mounts at this period,
usually costly Flanders or Valenciennes. In the series of prints by
Hollar of the Four Seasons, 1641, the veiled lady representing ‘Summer’
holds in her right hand an opened lace fan, the quaint legend at the foot
of the plate running as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line i04">‘In Sumer when wee walke to take the ayre,</div>
<div class="line">Wee thus are vayl’d to keep our faces faire,</div>

<p>The marriage of Charles II. with Catherine of Braganza in 1662 is
another landmark in the history of the fan in this country. The Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">Pg 179</a></span>and her Portuguese ladies introduced the gigantic green shading fans of
Moorish origin, which, in the absence of parasols (then unknown in
England), served also to shield the complexions of the ladies from the sun,
when they did not wish wholly to obscure their charms by putting on their
masks. The Indian trade, however, opened up by Catherine’s marriage
treaty, soon supplied the ladies of England with fans better adapted, by
their lightness and elegance, to be used as weapons of coquetry at balls
and plays.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>Large numbers of fan mounts were also imported from Italy, both
at this period and later. These are referred to incidentally in one of
Steele’s letters to the <i>Tatler</i>, April 23, 1709. ‘I am just come from visiting
Sappho [probably Mrs. Elizabeth Haywood, who had been some time on
the Irish stage]. As I came into the room she cries, “Oh, Mr. Bickerstaff,
I am utterly undone; I have broken that pretty Italian fan I showed you
when you were here last, wherein were so admirably drawn our first parents
in Paradise asleep in each other’s arms.”’<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p>The fan of Pope’s epigram was, it will be remembered, painted with the
story of Cephalus and Procris, the motto ‘Aura Veni.’</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Come gentle air! th’ Eolian shepherd said</div>
<div class="line">While Procris panted in the secret shade;</div>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">Pg 180</a></span></p>

<p>Two fine examples of early fans with subjects from classic mythology
appeared at the Walker sale; the first having a skin mount painted with
the Triumph of Amphitrite, in which the daughter of Nereus is seated in
a shell drawn by dolphins, with attendant nymphs and tritons, a figure of
Cupid, blindfolded, hovering above; this in allusion to Neptune having
sent the Dolphin to intercede for him, and to bring his innamorata from
the foot of Mount Atlas. The stick is rosewood, inlaid with rays of
mother-of-pearl. The second, from the collection of the Duchesse de
Nemours, representing the marriage of Neptune and Amphitrite, the subject
covering the whole field of a deep mount; the stick, mother-of-pearl,
carved with a pastoral scene and smaller panels of warriors.</p>

<p>Among the earliest English fans existing in private collections is a
mount of the time of Charles I., the original stick of which is said
to have been of gold, jewelled. The painting, a copy of the ‘Triumph of
Bacchus,’ by A. Carracci, is attributed (probably erroneously) to Peter Oliver.
The fan was given by the Princess Anne (afterwards Queen) to her god-daughter,
Sarah Robinson, daughter of Sir John Robinson, Master of the
Tower, and widow of the eldest son of Sir Humphrey Gore, on her
marriage, in 1696, with John Harvey, Esq., of Ickwellbury, Beds. It is
an example of a large class of fan mounts produced at this period, which
were reproductions of the works of the greater Italian masters, many of
which were, doubtless, copied by Italian artists, and either exported to
England, or acquired in Italy by visitors to that country.</p>

<p>Two interesting marriage fans of the period of Charles II., both painted
by the same hand, appeared at the Walker sale in 1882; the one, ‘An
Ancient Marriage,’ with the bridegroom presenting ring, the bride wearing
a floral chaplet and attended by maidens with distaff and flowers; the stick
of ivory, carved with emblematic figures, mother-of-pearl inlay, and silver
piqué. The subject of the other (Achilles and Deidamia) referring to the
taking of Troy; on the reverse a view of the park at St. Cloud; the stick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">Pg 181</a></span>mother-of-pearl, carved with subjects emblematic of marriage. These,
doubtless, were made by the French fan-makers who had become domiciled
in England, and probably, as Mr. Robert Walker suggests, for important
court personages.</p>

<p>It was upon the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, 1685, that the
French Huguenots being obliged, through the persecution of their compatriots,
to quit their own country, sought refuge in England as well as
other countries, where they were received with open arms. Amongst these
were a number of éventaillistes, who established an industry, having
brought with them, not only the money they had been able to save, but
what was still more valuable, their skill as workers, their habitual
diligence and thrift. ‘The countries whither they went were enriched by
the arts and trades which the French refugees introduced, and still more by
the examples of industry, probity, and sincere piety which they exhibited in
their own persons.’<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>In 1709, upon the ‘humble petition of the Ffanmakers that exercise
the Art and Mistery of Ffanmaking in London and Westminster and
Twenty Miles round,’ a Charter of incorporation was granted by Queen
Anne, providing that ‘all Ffanmakers within the prescribed area, and all
persons who have served, or shall hereafter serve, as Apprentices to the said
Art and Mistery by the space of seven years, and who hereafter, from time to
time, shall be Admitted into, or made free of the Society, shall be one Body
Corporate and Politick in Deed and in Name, with a common seal, with
power to hold lands, and power to sue and defend the same. Power to
make bye-laws touching the good estate, Rule, and Government of the
Society, and for the Reformation of such abuses and deceits as shall be
found to be committed by them either in uttering or making bad and
deceitfull works, as also in their several Offices, functions, Misteries, and
business touching the said Trade,’ etc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">Pg 182</a></span></p>
<p>During the latter half of the seventeenth and the first half of the
eighteenth centuries the importation of fans into this country from India,
China, and the East was considerable, and, together with the Italian
importation, already alluded to, threatened to ruin the home industry.
The fanmakers addressed themselves to Parliament, and demanded its prohibition,
with the result that a tax of forty shillings a dozen was imposed upon
all wooden- and feather-fans, and for a time the importation of all painted
fans was prohibited. In 1750 there appear to have been disputes between
the Fanmakers’ Company and journeymen fanmakers on account of non-payment
of quarterage. Two interesting items of information appear in
the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for October and December 1870 as follows:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘On the 28th ult. was try’d a cause between the Company of Fanmakers,
incorporated by Charter for the Cities of London, Westminster, and twenty miles
round, plaintiffs, and one Wagstaffe, defendant, for quarterage due to them, who was
ordered to pay it with costs.’</p>

<p>‘On the 28th ult. was a tryal in the Court of Requests, Westminster, between
the Company of Fanmakers, plaintiffs, and some fan-painters, defendants, for
non-payment of quarterage, which was determined for the defendants, it appearing
that they were not legal members of the said Company.’</p></blockquote>

<p>The two following items will serve to show the extent of the fan
industry in the middle of the eighteenth century, and the adverse conditions
under which it laboured.</p>

<p>‘A writer in the <i>Westminster Journal</i> for February 23, 1751 (quoted
by the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for the same year), proposes a tax upon plain
and printed fan mounts. Painted ones not coloured to pass free as before.
A sixpenny stamp to be affixed in the midst of a plain or printed paper
fan mount, and a shilling stamp on a leather one. This may produce
a revenue of ten, twenty, or thirty thousand pounds per annum, encourage
a very ingenious branch of business, and only hurt about half-a-dozen
paultry plate printers, who are enriching themselves and starving of
hundreds.’</p>

<p>The <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for November 1752 quotes an advertisement
which appeared in the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>, ‘from the poor unfortunate
artificers in the several branches of the fan trade, whose number is nearly
1000; returning thanks to the Company of Fanmakers for petitioning the
E. India directors to discontinue the importation of fans. To excite the
regard and compassion of the ladies, it asserts that the home-made fans
are in every way preferable to foreign; and that by discouraging the latter,
they will relieve a number of unfortunate families from the most grievous
distress and despair.’<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p>‘On the 7th February’ (<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, March 1753), ‘the
journeymen fanmakers presented the Princess Dowager of Wales with a
beautiful and elegant fan, far superior to Indian fans, which was most
graciously received.’ This, doubtless, with the idea of obtaining patronage
and support for the home-made article.</p>

<p>The imported fans were for the most part sold by tea-merchants and
dealers in Oriental wares.</p>

<p>A trade card in the Schreiber collection, British Museum, with an
elaborate engraved portrait of Queen Anne, states that John Roberts at the
Queen’s Head in Holborn, near Hatton Garden, London, sells all sorts of
Fine China Ware; the finest Hyson and Congo Teas, Fine Double Flint
Drinking Glasses, etc., <i>and India Fans</i>.</p>

<p>The fan <i>makers</i> also often combined the trade of fanmaking with the
sale of millinery and stationery. The Banks collection of Shop Bills
includes the following trade card:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Robert Pickeard, at the Swan and Golden Fan in Cheapside, near the
Conduit, London.</p>

<p>‘Mounteth and Maketh all sorts of Fans, and Selleth Silk Gauze and
Silver Handkerchiefs, Caps, Girdles, Ribbons, Roles, Wiers, Ferrits, Silver</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">Pg 184</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>Lace for Shoes, white Buttons for Shirts, Silk and Ferrit Laces, Masks and
Necklaces.</p>

<p>‘<i>N.B.</i>—Any Merchant may be furnished with all kinds of Milenary Wares at
Cheap Rates.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Also we find Honour Chassereau, Fan Maker and Stationer, Fan
and Crown, Long Acre, London, ‘selling all sorts of Stationery Wares,
Wholesale, Retail, and for Exportation.’</p>

<p>The principal enactments for the regulation of the import trade in
fans and materials of the fan are here enumerated:—</p>

<p>By the 11th Geo. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> cap. 7, calpins for fans are rated in the Custom
House books at 7s. 6d. a dozen, and the duty paid on importation 1s. 5d.
and 7/8ths a dozen.</p>

<p>If made of leather, and the leather be the most valuable part, for
every 20s. of real value upon oath, the duty is 6s.</p>

<p>By the 12th Charles <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> cap. 4, fans for women or children, of French
make, are rated in the Custom House books at £2 per dozen, and the
duty £1, 5s. per dozen. <i>But if these fans are painted, they are
prohibited to be imported, and are seizable as painted wares.</i> The
laws regulating the importation of embroidery are still more stringent.</p>

<p>By the Acts Richard <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> cap. 10, 3rd Edward <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> cap. 3, 19th Henry <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>
cap. 21, 5th Elizabeth, cap. 7, 13th and 14th Charles <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> cap. 13, 4th and
5th William and Mary, cap. 10, 9th and 10th William <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> cap. 9, 11th and
12th William <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> cap. 11, embroidery imported is forfeited, the importer
liable to £100, and the seller to £50.</p>

<p>The various materials, as gold and silver thread, or wire, lace fringe,
work made of copper, brass, or any other inferior metal, imported, <i>to be
forfeited and burnt</i>, and £100 paid by the importer of every parcel so
imported. This under 4th Edward <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, 10th Anne, cap. 26, 15th George <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>
cap. 20, and 22nd George <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span></p>

<p>By the 6th Anne, cap. 19, silks wrought or mixed with gold, silver,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">Pg 185</a></span>or other materials, clandestinely imported, are forfeited, with £200 for every
importer, and £100 by the receiver, seller, or concealer.</p>

<p>It therefore appears that either mounts, or fans that are painted, are
seizable; and that all fans or mounts embellished with gold or silver are
prohibited under very severe penalties, particularly under 4th Edward <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>,
and 15th and 22nd George <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> Further, paper fan-mounts could not be
imported without paying a duty of 55 per cent.; the duty on plain fans
being 27-1/2 per cent., or, if imported as toys, 37 per cent.</p>

<p>In a table of fees taken by packers and water-side porters for shipping
and landing the goods or merchandise of strangers, second charter of
Charles <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, 1660, ‘For a load of fans, one shilling.’</p>

<p>The vogue of fans became general during the first half of the eighteenth
century, when fan-painting was a most lucrative profession. The sculptor
Nollekens tells us that when his wife was a girl, her father’s intimate
friend Goupy (a well-known water-colour draughtsman who died in
London in 1763) was considered the most eminent of the fan-painters, and
that fan-painting was then so fashionable that the family of ‘Athenian
Stuart’ (so called on account of his exquisite studies of Athens) placed
him as a pupil to Goupy, conceiving that by so doing they had made
his fortune; and we learn from other sources that Stuart originally gained
his livelihood by painting fans.</p>

<p>A fan-mount in the Schreiber collection is painted with three medallions
of Roman views, The Arch of Constantine, The Arch of Titus, and The
Forum, the field of the fan decorated with delicate classical grotesques
and border, signed ‘Jose Goupy, 1738, N.A.’ The views are skilfully
drawn in pen line with wash, in the style of the water-colour draughtsmen
of this period, <i>i.e.</i> a low-toned scheme of colour, a good deal of india ink
being used. This signed example is of the greatest value in determining
the character of Goupy’s work, and it is extremely probable that he was
responsible for a good many mounts generally considered as Italian. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">Pg 186</a></span>
from Goupy, too, that Stuart originally derived his interest in classic architectural
remains, and, doubtless also, much of his skill in depicting them.</p>

<p>Fans had, indeed, at this period become an indispensable adjunct to
a lady’s toilet, a temporary loss of this instrument, upon occasion,
causing much perturbation of spirit. An amusing story of such a catastrophe
is told in <i>The Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for April 1736:</p>

<p>The fan-shops of Fleet Street, the Strand, and Westminster are continually
referred to in the advertisements which appeared from time to time
in the <i>Craftsman</i>. The two following note a change of ownership:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
‘Feb. 6, 1741-2.
</p>

<p>‘To be sold, at Gordon’s Fan warehouse, The Crown and Fan in Tavistock
Street, Covent Garden. All sorts of Fans. Wholesale and Retail, very cheap. The
Person leaving off trade.’</p>

<p>
‘Feb. 12 1742-3.
</p>

<p>‘Gordon’s Fan Warehouse, in Tavistock Street, Covent Garden. Mr. Gordon
having left off Trade, the Business, as usual, is carry’d on by his late journey-woman,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Hitchcock</span>,</p>

<p>At the same Place, where Ladies may be accommodated with all sorts of Fans, at the
most reasonable Rates.’</p></blockquote>

<p>From the extremely naïve and interesting ‘fan-shop’ fan belonging to
Mr. Messel we are able to gather some idea of what these shops were like.
The inscription on the shop sign is ‘Fanmaker, London,’ showing that the
district represented was within the London boundary of this period,
<i>c.</i> 1745.</p>

<p>During the comparatively brief reign of Queen Anne fans were again
made large. Sir Roger de Coverley, upon his courting the perverse widow,
declared that he would have allowed her the ‘profits of a windmill for her
fans.’<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>With the proverbial fickleness of fashion, however, this vogue lasted
but a short time; the fan lessened its proportions in the second and third
decades of the century, when, during the forties, its size once again
increased, following the lead of France. ‘Ventosus,’ writing in the <i>London
Magazine</i> for 1744, quotes, with some amusing comments, an epigram by
Dr. Atterbury, Bishop of Rochester, originally written upon a white fan
borrowed from Miss Osborne, afterwards his wife, and referred to by
Steele in the <i>Tatler</i> for October 19, 1710:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">Pg 188</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Flavia, the least and lightest toy</div>
<div class="line">Can with relentless art employ:</div>
<div class="line">This Fan, in meaner hands, would prove</div>
<div class="line">An engine of small force in love;</div>
<div class="line">Yet she, with graceful air and mien,</div>
<div class="line">Not to be told, or sagely seen,</div>
<div class="line">Directs its wanton motions so,</div>
<div class="line">That it wounds more than Cupid’s bow;</div>
<div class="line">Gives coolness to the matchless dame,</div>
<div class="line">To ev’ry other breast a flame.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘The whole turn of this,’ exclaims our commentator, ‘depends upon the
smallness and slightness of the Instrument—the least and lightest toy?
Fans now in vogue are both monstrously <i>large</i> and monstrously <i>strong</i>.
To say that a fan of eight or nine inches long, which, when extended in a
semi-circle could not admit a string of more than fourteen or fifteen,
<i>wounds more than Cupid’s Bow</i>, is somewhat extraordinary, but to ascribe
the same excellence to one of our modern <i>ventilators</i>, whose Diagonal line,
when it is full spread, is longer than one of the Bowstrings of our <i>Hoxton</i>
Archers, is ascribing nothing miraculous to it from the fair Hand that may
happen to use it.’</p>

<p>Our good Ventosus had witnessed an increase from ‘3 Quarters of a
Foot’ to ‘even 2 Foot within this week past’; he looks forward to a still
greater improvement when the fan would extend to the same distance as the
<i>fashionable Hoop</i>. This would introduce ‘somewhat of uniformity in a
Lady’s Dress, and the age would be agreeably engaged at either meeting or
following a fair Toast, with both her sails spread, in observing the harmony
between the <i>Curve at Top</i> and the <i>Curve at Bottom</i>,’ etc. Our ingenious
friend discovers other uses for such an instrument—‘a lady might mount it
horizontally, to skreen herself and Family against all the Inclemencies of
the weather.’</p>

<p>Again, at the Playhouse, a good-natured lady may ‘have it in her
power to oblige a whole Side Box by a single Puff, and prevent the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">Pg 189</a></span>Beaux, as well as the Belles, from fainting away at an extraordinary
Pathos.’</p>

<p>The possibilities of such an instrument have, apparently, no limit—‘a
Blast or two from this machine would be sufficient to whiff away to
a convenient Distance all troublesome and worthless Danglers, who may
attempt to besiege its fortunate possessor.’</p>

<p>Nay, besides private benefits, one of a national nature occurs to
the mind of our imaginative friend—‘20,000 such fans, properly drawn
up on the Shore, might <i>blow back</i> the next French invasion, or at least
keep off the Enemies’ Fleet till <i>our own</i> had Time to come up.’</p>

<p>Our author might indeed, with strict adherence to truth, have included
the beaux as well as the belles in this fanciful defence, with a proportionate
increase in the probability of victory. Amongst the effects referred to in
the inventory of a beau, who was carried off dead upon the taking away of
his snuff-box, and remained unburied, his goods being taken into execution
to defray the charge of his funeral—‘The strong-box of the deceased,
wherein were found five billet-doux, a Bath shilling, a crooked sixpence,
a silk garter, a lock of hair, and <i>three broken fans</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>In the postscript to Addison’s letter on the subject of his ‘Fan
Academy’—‘I teach young gentlemen the whole art of gallanting a fan.
<i>N.B.</i> I have reserved little plain fans, made for this use, to avoid
expense.’<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>At the dancing assemblies in London, Bath, and elsewhere, it was
customary for the gentlemen to select their partners by the ballot of fans,
which were placed in a hat, the owner of the fan drawn becoming the
partner of the gentleman who drew it. Mrs. Montagu, in one of her
letters, refers to this custom. ‘In the afternoon I went to Lord Oxford’s
ball at Marylebone. It was very agreeable; and the partners were chosen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">Pg 190</a></span>by their fans, but with a little <i>supercherie</i>.’ A lady’s fan was almost
as well known as her face, and it was not difficult, with a little contrivance,
to know which to draw. The same lady, writing from Bath in January
1740, says: ‘Last night I took to the more youthful diversion of dancing,
and am nothing but a fan (which my partner tore) the worse for it; our
beaux here may make a rent in a woman’s fan, but they will never make
a hole in her heart.’<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>The popularity of the union of the ‘Orange Tree with the English
Rose’ is abundantly testified by the number of painted fans issued of this
subject. A painted bridal-fan of the Princess Anne, daughter of George <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>,
married to the Prince of Orange in 1733, appeared at the Walker sale
in 1882, and sold for £26. In this the Princess is seated, attended by
the Loves and Graces.</p>

<p>The preliminaries of peace between Austria and France in 1748
provide a subject for a fan appearing at this same sale. The scene
represents a tented field. Maria Theresa, Queen of Hungary, joins hands
with la France, the rival banners inscribed—‘Vive Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span>, and Vive la
Reine d’Hungrie’; the English banner of St. George in front; at the
back the victory of Admiral Hawke. This probably executed for an
English partisan on the occasion of the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<p>A characteristic fan in the Wyatt collection, of the early part of the
century, has a paper mount painted with merry-making scenes, persons
dancing, drinking, musicians, etc.; the ivory stick carved <i>à jour</i>, painted
with birds and flowers; the guards, mother-of-pearl, carved and painted.</p>

<p>Mr. George Augustus Sala, in his entertaining preface to the fan
exhibition held at Drapers’ Hall in 1878, refers to a remarkably curious
fan exhibited some twenty years earlier, at a congress of the Archæological
Institute held at Worcester. This, evidently an English production, is
a gouache on vellum, representing either the Great Lottery of 1714, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">Pg 191</a></span>the equally remarkable gambling enterprise of 1718, when the popular
greed of gain was stimulated to such an extraordinary degree that a
million and a half sterling was subscribed.</p>

<p>The scene is the interior of Mercer’s Hall, Ironmonger Lane,
Cheapside, where transactions connected with lotteries took place, showing
the platform with side galleries conveniently arranged for a crowd of gay
gallants and fashionable dames in the full costume of the period; the
lottery tickets are in the course of being drawn by Blue-coat boys, a wheel
on either side for blanks and prizes. The design, says our author, is
identified with a contemporary engraving by H. Parr, ‘Les divertissements
de la Loterie,’ designed by T. Marchant, drawn by Gravelot, and published
by Ryland. Gravelot was a French engraver and decorative painter, invited
to this country by Claude Dubosc to assist in illustrating a sumptuous
history of the campaigns of Marlborough.</p>

<p>Of topographical fans, that owned by Miss Moss, giving a view
of Kensington Square as it appeared in the latter half of the seventeenth
century, is amongst the most interesting: it is extremely fresh in colour,
and exhibits a quaint sense of decorative treatment.</p>

<p>A fan with a view of Cavendish Square is attributed to Canaletto,
who in the latter part of his life visited London, where he was held in
great estimation. The subject is enclosed within a cartouche, with flowers,
etc., in the Chinese taste covering the rest of the field. The stick is of
ivory, carved <i>à jour</i>, with figures, birds, and foliated ornament; the edges,
when closed, form a subject in relief of birds, insects, and fruit, this being
a device adopted both in Holland, France, and Italy, but especially in
the first-named country. See page 202.</p>

<p>This fan appeared at the Walker sale in 1882, when it was acquired
by the late Baroness Burdett-Coutts.</p>

<p>Spangles appeared about the middle of the century, following the
fashion of France. These served as borderings to subject medallions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">Pg 192</a></span>
emphasised the leading lines of the design. A characteristic fan of this
period, 1750-1780, has either one or three medallions or cartouches, of
pastoral or other subjects, with graceful figures reminiscent of Gainsborough,
Hoppner, and other masters of the English school. These figure medallions
were usually supplemented by smaller ones of musical or other trophies,
dainty flowers, festoons, and borders, the mount being usually silk.</p>

<p>The sticks of these fans were narrow, the number varying from
fourteen to sixteen, including the panaches, the latter delicately carved
<i>à jour</i>. The material was generally ivory, but occasionally mother-of-pearl.
The brins were perfectly straight and flat in the shoulder
portion, but invariably richly decorated with embossed gold and silver
work, this often taking the form of a cartouche extending over six or
eight of the sticks, spangles also being freely used.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to discover a more perfect example of this
class of fan, so peculiarly English in type, than the one exhibited at
South Kensington in 1870 by the Baroness Meyer de Rothschild. In
this the centre medallion represents a lady carrying a lap-dog, visiting a
friend who is seated at an embroidery frame; on the inferior panels, a girl
playing with a dove, and a boy with a bird-cage and a tethered bird. The
mount is silk, with spangled borderings, the stick ivory, finely carved <i>à jour</i>,
decorated in variegated gold; jewelled stud. (Illustrated facing p. 180.)</p>

<p>A number of fans were painted by Poggi, who was publishing engraved
fans at this period, and whose fans enjoyed a high reputation. We find
the following entry in Madame D’Arblay’s Journal for March 1781:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Tuesday.—I passed the whole day at Sir Joshua Reynolds’s with Miss Palmer,
who, in the morning, took me to see some beautiful fans painted by Poggi, from
designs of Sir Joshua, Angelica, West, and Cipriani, on leather. They are, indeed,
more delightful than can well be imagined; one was bespoke by the Duchess of
Devonshire, for a present to some woman of rank in France, that was to cost £30.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Church-fans are referred to more fully in another chapter of this work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">Pg 194</a></span>(page 248). The painted variety gave such subjects as ‘The Meeting of
Isaac and Rebecca,’ ‘Judith with the Head of Holofernes,’ ‘The Marriage
at Cana,’ ‘Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.’ An early example appeared
at the Walker sale in 1882, having a deep mount painted with the subject
of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden; the stick ivory, with the silver
piqué ornament so popular during the reigns of Charles <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, Queen Anne,
and George <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span></p>

<p>Mourning-fans are easily recognisable from their generally sombre
appearance. In these, the character of the subject is apparently a matter
of small consequence so long as the general colour scheme is that of
a funeral card, viz. black, white, and silver. In the Wyatt collection is an
example of about 1750 painted in black with a pastoral scene, the stick and
guards ivory, painted in black in imitation of the Chinese.</p>

<p>The extraordinary popularity of Wedgwood’s jasper ware was not
without its influence on the fan. The example in the possession of Lady
Bristol has a richly carved ivory stick with medallion subjects of Diana
hunting, etc., with amorini, terminal figures, and fauns, in imitation of
blue and black jasper, the panels silver piqué. The mount is of silk, with
centre panel in the style of Angelica Kauffmann, the border and ornaments
in gold and silver spangles, with painted Wedgwood medallions again
introduced. (Illustrated facing p. 176.)</p>

<p>It is not difficult to fix its date. Wedgwood had perfected his jasper
process by 1777, and it may be taken that the fan was produced between
this year and 1780.</p>

<p>The painted ivory brisé fans of the latter part of the eighteenth century
are typically English, though derived from an Italian source. They are
quite easy of identification, being invariably delicately pierced with a fretwork
pattern, painted with medallions usually one superior and two inferior,
and gilt, the gold being usually applied with the brush; the fan opening
out to the third of a circle.</p>

<p>An extremely interesting example is decorated with three medallions,
the centre representing a sleeping nymph with Cupids. This formerly
belonged to Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, and was presented to
Queen Alexandra when Princess of Wales by the Duke of Sutherland in
remembrance of his mother.</p>

<p>The marriage relations of the Prince of Wales (afterwards George <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>)
with Mrs. Fitzherbert formed the subject of an ivory fan, exquisitely cut
in fretwork, with three painted cartouches by Richard Cosway, the centre
representing the Prince and lady with Religion descending in a chariot
pointing with pleading looks to a figure of Hymen, who hovers above; in
the two other cartouches the pair are figured in the characters of Fidelity
and Constancy. This fan was exhibited at South Kensington in 1870;
it appeared at the Walker sale in 1882, when it was sold for eighteen
guineas. In 1889 it was in the possession of Colonel de Lancey, and is
now in the Hennin collection, Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p>

<p>The fan in the Wyatt collection, elaborately pierced, painted, and gilt,
has three medallions finely painted in the style of Cosway, with two small
medallions of heads on the guards. The connecting ribbon is green, the
general colour effect being extremely good. The fan opens out to a third of
a circle, the length of the blades 10 inches. (Illustrated facing p. 182.)</p>

<p>The leaf-fan belonging to Mrs. Hungerford Pollen, of the taking of
Malta, refers to the surrender of the island to the British by General
Vaubois, the act being signed and concluded on the 5th September 1800.
The subject is on a large cartouche, occupying three-fourths of the leaf,
the background representing a streamer of lace.</p>

<p>During the period of the Napoleonic wars, a number of French
prisoners were installed in England at Norman Cross near Peterborough,
Porchester Castle, and Edinburgh Castle, and during their confinement
introduced the process of straw marquetry, which had been practised on
the Continent since the time of Henry <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, and possibly earlier. Boxes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">Pg 196</a></span>
trays, decorative pictures, nick-nacks, and hand-screens were made.
Towards the end of the eighteenth century straw plaiting became vastly
fashionable, and straw was adopted for hats, ribbons, plumes, girdles, and
tassels. The fan was not behindhand, but followed the prevailing taste.</p>

<p>Several of these objects appear in the Victoria and Albert Museum,
amongst them being two hand-screens with plaited views.</p>

<p>The fashion lasted well into the nineteenth century, when an extensive
manufacture was also carried on in India (Bengal) for exportation to Europe.
This chiefly consisted of hand-screens of the pear-shaped gourd type, rush
being the material employed.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption"> OSTRICH FEATHER FOLDING-FAN<br />
(From the portrait group by Van Loon
at Amsterdam.)</span></span>THE people of the Netherlands have been
famous, from the Middle Ages onwards, for
the splendour of their costumes. We have
an account of Jane of Navarre, wife of
Philippe le Bel, who, upon the occasion of
a visit to Bruges in 1301, was so much
struck by the pomp and magnificence displayed
by the inhabitants, particularly the
ladies, that she exclaimed, ‘What do I
see! I thought I alone was Queen, but here I find them by whole
hundreds.’</p>

<p>The fact that fans were largely used in the Low Countries during the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is evidenced by the frequency of their
appearance in painted and engraved representation. In the ‘Omnium pene
Europæ, Asiæ, Aphricæ, atque Americæ Gentium habitus,’ engraved
by A. de Bruÿn, and published at Antwerp in 1581, nine years anterior to
the earliest edition of Vecellio, the long-handled plumed fan appears in the
hands of a Belgian lady; the shorter-handled tuft-fan is also carried by

<p>In the engraving by ‘J. Côyens et C. Mortier,’ of the family of Frederick
and Elizabeth, King and Queen of Bohemia, the young Princess Louysa
holds a dark ostrich feather-fan with a mirror in the centre.</p>

<p>In the large portrait group by Van Loon at Amsterdam, of the family
of Jan Miense Molenaer, a lady holds a folding-fan of white ostrich
feathers, the wavy ivory sticks numbering five; in the same picture another
lady holds a small rigid feather-fan composed of the feathers of one of the
smaller birds.</p>

<p>In the engraved work by de Bruÿn above referred to, the large folding-fan
appears constantly, though not in the hands of the Netherlandish ladies;
the fashion of the fan was, however, substantially the same in most countries
of Europe. Painted mounts appeared early, and were also large; the
extremely interesting mount in the possession of the Dowager-Marchioness
of Bristol being probably one of the earliest existing Dutch examples.
The subject evidently refers to one of the Dutch settlements in the East
Indies, probably the town of Batavia, built by the Dutch in the early years
of the seventeenth century. Here is represented a quay, where merchandise
(mostly fruits and fish) is being landed from boats, and on which buying
and selling is taking place. In the background are buildings of a European
character, with a volcanic range of mountains in the distance. A high-masted
vessel is moored in the bay, and is partially seen behind the
buildings. In the immediate foreground are two cannon-balls mounted on
low pedestals. The long veils and other details of costume are similar to
those worn by the Dutch during the first half of the century, seen in contemporary
engravings; the remarkable peaked, plaited straw-hats are
practically identical with those made by the natives of the Malay Archipelago.
The leaf, which has been removed from the stick and stretched
upon a frame, is painted in gouache or paper, probably a little later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">Pg 198</a></span></p>

<p>Of subject fans, historical or fanciful, that illustrated from the collection
of Miss Moss (Antony and Cleopatra) is amongst the most charming in
its quaint <i>naïveté</i>, and is almost certainly Dutch. The Queen is about to
dissolve the pearl, which she exhibits to the astonished Antony and the
serving-woman beside her. Cooks in the foreground prepare the dishes,
while servitors carry them to the table. An old-fashioned chimney-corner
is seen on the left, with fire-dogs and pot hanging. Music is provided by
harpsichord, lute, and fiddle. The costume is of a nondescript character,
Antony wearing an extraordinary plumed helmet, the Queen in ermined
cloak, both having diadems. The mount, of skin, is particularly pleasant
in colour quality, and probably belongs to the last years of the seventeenth
century. The stick and guards of a later date. A still finer example,
similar in the character of the painting, though of a somewhat later date,
is the fan illustrated by gracious permission of H.R.H. Princess Louise,
Duchess of Argyll, facing page 1; this was the gift of the Duke of Coburg
to Princess Victoria (afterwards Queen) in 1836, from the collection of fans
at Gotha. These two fan leaves, as also Lady Bristol’s, may be accepted as
original productions, <i>i.e.</i> the work of artists possessing some inventive
power, rather than, as in the case of so many fan leaves, mere transcripts of
well-known pictures.</p>

<p>An extremely interesting type of mount has a large vignette, usually
of two figures, occupying the centre, or the whole field of the fan. In
these fans the sticks are of carved ivory, often strongly reminiscent of
Chinese design, or having costume figures of the character with which we are
familiar in early woodcuts. Two examples in the Wyatt collection represent
pastoral groups, extremely good in style, the colour scheme being
most effective.</p>

<p>In the treatment of the mount the Dutch invariably followed the
practice of Italy and France. Many were painted in the Chinese taste,
some in imitation of the finer fans of China. The sticks of these were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">Pg 199</a></span>usually of pierced ivory. An excellent example in the Wyatt collection
shows in the centre compartment the garden of a Chinese house, with
seated figures and visitors arriving. A panel on the right represents an
astronomer making observations, and on the left is a fight between men
in boats on a river. A capital effect is obtained in this fan by means of
line work in gold, this being particularly effective over the blue water
in the boat scene.</p>

<p>The fan illustrated facing page 198 is interesting from the cut-work of
the mount, an imitation of the cut-work Italian fans of the seventeenth
century; in this instance, the pattern is produced by means of stamping,
done before the leaf is painted. The stick and guards are extremely
effective, and are of ivory, pierced, carved, painted and gilt.</p>

<p>Flemish fans are often decorated with subjects from Scripture history;
as Jacob and Rachel, Abraham entertaining the three Angels, scenes from
the lives of Elijah, Ruth, and Boaz; these evidently for use at church. A
fine example of the end of the seventeenth century appeared at the Walker
sale in 1882, and passed into the Franks collection. This is a crowded
composition of the passage of the Israelites through the Red Sea; the stick
of plain ivory, the guards carved with figures of Bellona.</p>

<p>The subject of Rinaldo in the Garden of Armida also occurs on a fan
in the Wyatt collection, the mount chicken skin, the style and colouring
that of the later Roman school of painting. The stick and guards of ivory,
carved with scroll-work and figures, the date about 1700.</p>

<p>Embroidery was also employed. An unusual example, the method
scarcely to be commended on account of the weight, is also in the Wyatt
collection, with a naturalistic landscape and figures, the embroidered
work covering the whole field of the fan, and consequently rendering it
heavy both in appearance and actual weight. The stick and guards are
tortoise-shell, pierced and embossed with gold, probably of a later date than
the mount, which may be put at <i>c.</i> 1650.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">Pg 200</a></span></p>

<p>The method of painting upon ivory, with a subsequent covering of
varnish, if indeed it was not anticipated by the Dutch, was practised in
Holland concurrently with the brothers Martin in France. It was an instance
in which a new departure or fresh invention occurred simultaneously in
several places, but whether the Dutch, Italians, or French were the first in
the field with this method of decoration, it is certain that the varnish was
perfected by Martin.</p>

<p>The ivory brisé fans of the Dutch were, like the French, small in size,
and at the end of the seventeenth century, says Redgrave, were frequently
imported into Paris and decorated in ‘Vernis Martin.’ In a most effective
type of fan, the plain cream white of the ivory forms part of the decorative
scheme; three medallions, one large and two small, of landscapes with
figures in the foreground, form the sole decorations; the ivory background,
the green connecting ribbon, and the prevailing blues and greens of the
panels, constitute a most pleasant harmony. These fans usually open
out to a little more than a quarter of a circle. An example appears
in the Wyatt collection.</p>

<p>In another type, the plain ivory sticks are painted in the Chinese
taste, the fans slightly larger than those previously referred to. In some,
purely Chinese <i>motifs</i> are employed; in others, a semi-naturalistic
arrangement of flowers and festoons is associated with the Martin type of
decoration on the guards and lower semicircle of the fan.</p>

<p>In an extremely interesting fan in the Wyatt collection, this principle
is carried further by the introduction of three medallions of single figures—a
man with a cask of wine on his back, holding a lantern and goblet, and
two female figures of flower- and fruit-sellers; the guards and lower
semicircle in the Chinese taste, the blades connected by a green ribbon.</p>

<p>Perhaps the prettiest and most characteristic of the Dutch ivory fans
are those in which the blades are cut in fine open work, and a border of from
1-1/2 to 2 inches, delicately painted with flowers, fruit, birds, and butterflies.</p>

<p>In some instances the principal portions of the decoration are of thin ivory
applied and afterwards painted.</p>

<p>In these fans the connecting silk ribbon is usually white, and placed
immediately below the painted border, instead of on the edge. This
arrangement allows the ends of the blades to be rounded or otherwise
ornamented.</p>

<p>Sandalwood is pierced and painted in a similar way to ivory, forget-me-nots
being a favourite <i>motif</i> for the decoration, first on account of
their suitability of sentiment—as love-gifts—and also by reason of the blue
of the flower harmonising with the colour of the sandalwood. In some
examples the background of this forget-me-not wreath or border is pierced,
the connecting ribbon being also blue of a slightly different tint to the
flowers.</p>

<p>The horn-fans are either pierced entirely in flat open work, or painting
is employed as an additional enrichment, both sides of the fan being usually
decorated with garlands in gouache. A pretty fan in the Wyatt collection
has five heart-shaped garlands with the colour of the flowers alternately
red and pink, the light-blue connecting ribbon forming a very effective
contrast to the natural colour of the horn; indeed the connecting ribbon in
each instance forms a decorative feature, the colours being of pink, blue,
brown, or white, as the colour scheme demands. The horn is either of
its natural colour, or stained to various hues, generally saffron.</p>

<p>There are also the small fans decorated with spangles, much in vogue
both in Holland and elsewhere towards the close of the eighteenth century
and later. The mounts are of white gauze or net, decorated with pierced
and cut steel ornaments and spangles, embroidered with gold thread and
braid, the stick and guards usually of stained horn inlaid with steel.</p>

<p>A charming example of the small spangled Dutch fan is of silk, with
an inserted band of gauze ornamented with silver spangles and stamped
silver ornaments, the stick and guards of horn with inserted spangles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">Pg 202</a></span></p>

<p>Dutch sticks often present qualities which are remarkable and unusual,
the curious example owned by Mr. Messel being a case in point. This,
by a device at once simple, ingenious, and effective, is made to resemble,
when closed, a Chinese pagoda, and is probably an imitation of a Chinese
original. The leaf is of small interest, being poorly painted in the Chinese
taste; the costumes of the figures are, however, of applied straw of various
colours.</p>

<p>The practice of carving the edges of the closed stick with figures, heads,
or ornament, though not confined to the Dutch, was employed by them to
perhaps a greater extent than in other countries. The curious example
in the possession of Sir L. Alma-Tadema, showing a well-carved head at
the handle, presents interest at either front, side, or back view of the closed
fan. The leaf also of this fan, no less than the stick, presents points of
exceptional interest, and represents two figures of a botanist and lady
seated in a garden laid out with fountains, etc., a villa in the distance, and
possibly refers to Linnæus, and either the villa of Harmanby, about a
league from Upsala, which he used as a summer residence and converted
into a little university, his pupils following him thither, or the Queen’s
gardens at Ulriksdal, near Stockholm, arranged by the illustrious botanist.</p>

<p>The great traditional school of German design has never affected the
fan, nor is it desirable that it should; though a <i>plumed</i> fan, or, for that
matter, a <i>folding</i> one, designed by a Dürer would indeed be a precious
possession.</p>

<p>German fans present no characteristics peculiar to the Teutonic race;
the type is French, tinctured perhaps by a certain heaviness of effect, lacking
the light, dainty touch of the French. A few, however, reach a high level
of excellence, and compare favourably with the best French workmanship,
notably an early example, illustrated, which appeared at the Exhibition at
South Kensington in 1870, given to H.M. Queen Victoria by H.R.H. the
Prince Consort, from the collection of fans at Gotha. In this the mount is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">Pg 203</a></span>vellum painted with a pastorelle, the stick of ivory, carved with a series
of miniature figures under canopies, coloured, and gilt. The guards are
extremely curious, being cylindrical in shape, the lower segment fluted,
the shoulder carved with arabesques, and surmounted by small heads.</p>

<p>Another fine example (illustrated facing p. 4), from the collection
of H.R.H. the Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, was also the gift of
the Prince Consort to Queen Victoria, and is decorated with a series of
medallions of dancing figures, etc.</p>

<p>A type of fan, apparently peculiar to Germany, common during the
eighteenth century, has painted subjects cut out and laid on lace or net, a
kind of painting appliqué, the effect extremely good. An example decorated
with pastoral groups was exhibited at South Kensington by H.R.H.
Madame la Comtesse de Paris; the stick ivory, carved <i>à jour</i>, with figures
laid on gold-foil; the foliage, etc., coloured. This was bought in Dresden
about 1860. A fan similar in character, the date about 1765, was exhibited
at Karlsruhe in 1890.</p>

<p>‘If the fans of the eighteenth century,’ says Mr. H. F. Holt,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> ‘yielded
in grace and elegance to those of the sixteenth, they certainly (upon
occasion) exceeded them in richness and magnificence, the materials used
being often costly Flanders lace, the handles splendidly ornamented and
inlaid with jewels. As the climax, however, of costly magnificence,’ continues
this writer, ‘I will conclude with a description of the fan of the
Duchess of York, who, shortly after her arrival in England, displayed a
pleated fan entirely of diamonds, with an ivory stick pierced and set with
diamonds in a mosaic pattern; the outside ones were set with a single row
of diamonds, whilst very large brilliants fastened the fan at the bottom.’</p>

<p>The eighteenth century was indeed, <i>par excellence</i>, the era of the
fan, which was to be seen in the hands of every woman, from princess
to peasant.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>ENGRAVED FANS OF THE SEVENTEENTH AND
EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES. PART I</h3>

<p><span class="figleft100" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/i_416.jpg" width="100" height="290" alt="" /></span>
THE practice of engraving fans, begun tentatively in
Italy by Agostino Carracci in the latter half of the
sixteenth century, and in France by Callot somewhat
later, did not become general until the close of the
century that followed, although two names—those of
Abraham Bosse and Nicholas Loire—stand out prominently
during this interval.</p>

<p>The engraving of Carracci referred to in an early
chapter of this work, and illustrated opposite, must be
regarded as merely a design for a fan, serving no other
purpose apparently, in its engraved form, than as a record of a
type of fan now practically obsolete, and of which no examples in
their complete or original state remain to us.</p>

<p>The earliest engraved fans take the form of the hand-screens
in general use in Italy and elsewhere at this period. Of these, the
engraving known as ‘l’éventail de Callot,’ much sought after by
iconophilists, was produced in the year 1619, and is one of the
most esteemed plates of the master. The subject is a fête or carnival
on the Arno, given at Florence on the 25th of July of that year by the
Corporations of Weavers and Dyers, the whole subject being enclosed
in a characteristic cartouche, on the lower portion of which the name
‘Jacomo Callot fec.’ appears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">Pg 205</a></span></p>

<p>Two states of this engraving are known. The first, before the
inscription on the ribbon and the name on the cartouche, being extremely
rare.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>Callot has been credited with a second fan, which also takes the form
of a cartouche of similar shape to the first mentioned. The subject is
a dance in a garden—six persons are seen dancing a minuet before an
assembled company. This engraving, however, is rightly ascribed by the
best authorities to Stefano della Bella.</p>

<p>This subject was imitated and amplified by Nicolas Cochin the elder,
the composition rearranged, a larger number of figures introduced, with
a different and more elaborate background, the cartouche being similar.</p>

<p>Cochin also produced a subject of the Triumph of David, who is
represented on horseback, sword in hand, with the head of Goliath,
the cartouche copied from Callot, inscribed ‘Balthasar Montcornet, ex
Cum privilegio a paris.’</p>

<p>Another of these engraved hand-screens consists of a frame composed
of two large eagles, with the arms of Austria and Medicis, enclosing a
view of the Villa Reale near Florence, freely etched in the manner of
Israel Silvestre.</p>

<p>A set of four hand-screens was engraved by Christopher Fredr.
Hörman; prints of Nos. 3 and 4 appear in the British Museum collection.
No. 3 is included in Lady Charlotte Schreiber’s book, No. 4
being reproduced here. The subjects are ballet dancers in fantastic
costume, accompanied by, in each instance, a figure playing a musical
instrument.</p>

<p>The distinguished French engraver, Abraham Bosse (born 1602, died
1676), engraved three fans during the years 1637-38, much valued by
collectors. The ornament of these, designed in a florid Renaissance style,
consists of amorini, masks, festoons, etc., enclosing medallions of mytho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">Pg 206</a></span>logical
subjects—the first being the birth of Adonis, Venus and Adonis,
and the death of Adonis; the second—the Judgment of Paris, a Cupid
drawing his bow, and a Cupid with a crown; the third—the four ages:
of gold, silver, bronze, and iron.</p>

<p>No examples of these engravings appear in the British Museum
collection. A print of the Judgment of Paris is in the Bibliothèque
Nationale, but permission to reproduce it could not be obtained.</p>

<p>The title-page of Nicholas Loire’s work, <i>Desseins de grands Éventails</i>,
appears in the Schreiber collection, together with six engravings from the
work. This title-page, by far the most characteristic design of the series,
takes the form of a folding-fan, full size. Its subject is an arabesque,
composed of a droll with cap and bells playing a guitar, and two fantastic
dancing figures on an ornamental festooned platform supported by the
wings of female terminals; cornucopia, amorini, vases and flowers serve
to complete the composition. It is inscribed: ‘Divers Desseins de grands
Eventails, Ecrans, et autres Ornamens, Inventés et Gravés par Nicholas
Loire, A Paris chez Jombert rüe Dauphin, No. 56,’ and signed ‘Loire
fecit.’</p>

<p>The designs, which measure eight inches, are evidently intended to
form the central subjects of fans, to be completed and coloured by hand.
They include ‘The Judgment of Paris,’ enclosed in a cartouche with
Cupids, fruit, etc.; an eastern goddess, seated under a canopy, the
drapery of which is sustained by two serving-men; Isaac and Rebekah;
The finding of Moses; Venus; and Europa.</p>

<p>The topical fan, having reference to royal and distinguished personages,
or recording public events, was entirely the product of the eighteenth
century. It was, broadly speaking, born with the century, and died with
it. During this period, the engraved fan became a purveyor of history,
a kind of running commentary on the affairs of the hour. It was the
fan of the people—the poor relation of the more aristocratic painted fan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">Pg 207</a></span>
‘Ill drawn, roughly modelled, and often vilely bedaubed,’ says Henri
Bouchot in his entertaining ‘History on Fans,’<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> ‘its genesis is not hard
to determine; its fathers were Callot and Abraham Bosse, and its mothers
the coquettes of the <i>grand siècle</i>.’ We shall, therefore, lightly, though
perhaps somewhat too swiftly, traverse the fascinating period above indicated,
with this sprightly annotator for guide, which finds amusement in
‘Malbrouk’ and his mock burial, follows Stanislaus into his enforced retirement
in Alsace, alternately sympathises with and mocks at the woes of the
unfortunate Louis and his family, with apparent careless nonchalance
records the chief scenes of the reign of terror, celebrates the amazing
triumphs, and witnesses the ultimate defeat of Napoleon.</p>

<p>Naval and military events, for reasons which will be sufficiently
obvious, play a comparatively unimportant part in French fan decoration.
‘Malbrouk’ (Marlborough) is, however, lampooned in three scenes from
the popular song of ‘Malbrouk,’ said to have been composed on the night
after the battle of Malplaquet, September 11, 1709, and a plagiarism
of a Huguenot song on the death of the Duc de Guise,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> written by Théodore

<p>On the back of the fan are nineteen verses of the song with music,
and the refrain: ‘Miron, ton-ton-ton-miron.’</p>

<p>An example appears in Miss Moss’s collection, with the reverse only
engraved, the obverse painted in gouache on skin, the stick ivory, pierced
and carved.</p>

<p>Several versions of the engraved fan are extant—one with similar
arrangements to that above described, and the Histoire de Malbrouk in
thirty-one verses on the back. A second has, for centre, Malbrouk’s body
carried by soldiers; on the left, Madame on tower, page bringing news,
both in tears; on the right the tomb, ten verses from the second part
of the song, filling the field of the fan. On a third, in the centre,
Malbrouk taking leave; on the left, page bringing news of his death;
on the right, the tomb; on the reverse, the verses of the song, with music,
and the refrain:</p>

<p>The fan of ‘La Coquette,’ with those of ‘la Belle Chanteuse’ and
‘le Galant,’ and portraits of Babet the flower-girl (a popular character of
the period), were issued by the dealer Crépy and sold by the score to the
frequenters of the theatre.</p>

<p>La Coquette herself, with her <i>paniers</i> occupying nearly a third of
the fan, demurely takes her tea. She is, doubtless, the sister of
Mademoiselle Alluré, who dances to the music of a viola, while the
small half-opened fan, the fan within the fan, sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container padr2">

<div class="line">Elle est à l’allure, mon cousin,</div>
<div class="line">Mon cousin à l’allure!’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The half-opened fan of ‘La Coquette’ is also provided with a subject
of which, perhaps, the less said the better:</p>

<div class="poetry-container padl4">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Cette Evantail est magnifique</div>

<div class="line">Il faut dire un sol, la, mi, la. (Un sot l’a mis là!)’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The peasant girl, with her panier on hip and panier on arm, is also
a coquette; ‘Je vais en Vendange remplir mon Panier,’ says she, the
sort of vintage the cunning Margot hopes for being sufficiently obvious,
even without the love-knot that loops the frame of the miniature with
its accompanying legend, ‘J’ay bien des camarades sur la place,’ and the
knave of diamonds standing hard by.</p>

<p>The ‘little air’ with its explanatory picture says:</p>

<p>A pictorial rebus (referring to ‘l’éventail magnifique’), a game board,
a harlequin, and a billet-doux (N’oubliez pas le porteur) complete the
composition; the whole being an instance of the Parisian’s insatiable
love of badinage. Printed in Paris in 1734.</p>

<p>In <i>Le bal des Nations</i>, the several countries are figured as pretty
women at a costume ball; this representing the fan’s comment on the
declaration of war with the Emperor Charles <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span> Each of the actors of
the piece delivers a song, the words of which are printed round the top
of the fan. La France sings:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>La France is followed by L’Espagne, La Sardaigne, L’Italie, L’Allemagne,
La Saxe, La Russie, La Pologne, La Turquie, La Hollande
and L’Angleterre. The air, (le Bel Age), printed on the fan.</p>

<p>Events failed to bear out the fan’s predictions. The news of the
defeat of Stanislaus was carefully concealed from Queen Marie, the king
causing a special copy of the <i>Gazette</i> to be printed announcing her
father’s successes.</p>

<p>The queen, however, remained in ignorance but a short while; the
fan, the popular newspaper of the period, very speedily announced—‘Capture
of Dantzic by the Russians, unconditional surrender.’ The
picture—Stanislaus escaping through a gateway with his band of
mounted followers.</p>

<p>‘Malbrouk’ crops up again towards the middle of the century; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">Pg 211</a></span>folly of ‘Pantins’<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> and Bilboquets had been superseded by le ‘fureur
de cabriolets,’ to be in turn driven away by ‘Malbrouk.’ ‘Une Folie
chasse l’autre’ exhibits ‘Malbrouk’ fully equipped with sword and
buckler, issuing from a tent held open by a fool in cap and motley,
driving away figures of a woman playing bilboquet, a dancing abbé with
Pantin, a cabaret-keeper, and a man with flag and lantern.</p>

<p>We have also a satire on the separation of America from England,
who is represented as a cow, with America in the act of sawing off its
horns; Holland milking it; Spain waiting to receive the milk. A lion
representing England has lost its right paw. To the left ‘Jacques Rosbif’
and a companion in despairing attitudes, with the deed of separation and
a bale of goods labelled ‘TEE.’ The whole scene is being witnessed</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">Pg 212</a></span></p>
<p>by a group of figures representing the Powers of Europe, with a paper

<p>The capture of Granada by the French fleet under the Comte
d’Estaing, in 1799, is commemorated, the fan illustrating the sea-fight
between French and English ships.</p>

<p>The fortunes of the ill-fated Louis Seize and his beautiful consort
are followed to the final tragedy of 1793 with its momentous consequences.
We have seen how the good citizens of Dieppe celebrated the
joyful occasion of the birth of the dauphin by the gift to the queen-mother
of a precious fan of carved ivory. On the more humble printed
fan, Immortality, amid a great concourse of people, with fireworks and
illuminations in the background, presents the royal infant on a cushion,
to kneeling, admiring, and devoted France, who offers a basket of hearts.
The inscription, ‘Le Dauphin présenté par l’immortalité, la France saisie
d’admiration offre pour hommage à son Prince chéri les cœurs unis et
respectueux de ses fidèles sujets.’</p>

<p>Again the fan sings the birth of the dauphin; in this the royal
infant, in leading-strings, advances to meet the king, his father, who is
standing near. Above, a genius floats in the air, with a wreath and two
shields of arms bearing fleurs-de-lys and two dolphins. On either side
are verses entitled ‘Chanson sur la Naissance du Dauphin. Air, de la
Pantoufle.’</p>

<p>The song of ‘Malbrouk’ came once again into fashion in 1782. It
was sung by the nurse to the infant dauphin, and hence became one of
the favourite tunes of Marie-Antoinette. Beaumarchais introduced it into
<i>Le Mariage de Figaro</i> in 1784, the piece having been privately performed
before the king at Versailles, the queen taking the part of
Suzanne. ‘Malbrouk,’ say the authors of the <i>Mémoires Secrets de
Bachaumont</i>, ‘has become the hero of every fashion—to-day everything is
“à la Malbrouk”—ribbons, head-dresses, waistcoats, above all, <i>hats</i> “à la
Malbrouk,” and one sees all the ladies, either walking in the streets,
on the promenade, or at the play, “rigged out” in this grotesque
couvre-chef.’</p>

<p>Most things mundane, however, come to an end sooner or later—even
the star of Malbrouk, in its turn, is eclipsed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Malbrouck n’a plus d’empire,</div>
<div class="line">Les beaux jours sont passés,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>On a fine evening at the end of August 1783, the peasants of
Gonesse were astonished by a ‘bolt from the blue’ in the shape of
Professor Charles’s balloon. ‘What is it?’ they exclaim—‘some strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">Pg 214</a></span>
demon, or a visitant from Mars.’ The machine, which had no occupant,
King Louis having objected to a man risking his neck, only escaped
destruction by the interference of the parish priest. Here, surely, was
an opportunity for the fan, by which, as a matter of fact, it was not slow
in profiting. Balloon-fans became at once the mode, and ‘La Mode’
appropriated the balloon; hats ‘au ballon,’ everything—dresses, ribbons,
even hair, ‘au ballon.’</p>

<p>On December 1st of the same year, MM. Charles and Robert made
their ascent in the gardens of the Tuileries. We therefore have a fan
representing the departure of ‘les deux intrépides,’ with a group of spectators,
among whom are two members of the Royal House, ‘des
seigneurs <i>quantité</i>.’ On the reverse, two lines of music and five stanzas
of verse, of which the first runs as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘De l’aerostatique sphère</div>
<div class="line">françois admirez la splandeur</div>

<div class="line">le sigue qui nous attendrit</div>
<div class="line">c’est la maison interessante (bis)</div>
<div class="line">des gemeaux quelle nous ravit.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There was an echo in England. An illustration of the event forms
the centre subject of a fan in the Schreiber collection. On the left,
Biaggini’s Air Balloon is about to ascend; and on the right, The Fall of
ye Balloon, the confused mass being viewed with curiosity by three rustics.</p>

<p>In the following March, M. Blanchard made his ascent in his
balloon with four rudders; the event duly recorded on a fan inscribed
‘La Phisico Mécanique Ou le Vaisseau Volant de Mr. Blanchard.’
The song of four stanzas, ‘Oh parbleu voici du plaisant. Vive la
Phisique,’ etc.</p>

<p>There were painted as well as engraved balloon-fans—with a centre
medallion of two fair damsels viewing ‘sa forme circulaire,’ a smaller
medallion of a balloon on either side, the field of the fan in the glitter
of stars, spangles, and dotted ornaments.</p>

<p>Thus Carlyle, with his characteristic <i>double entente</i>, philosophising
on these events: ‘Beautiful invention; mounting heavenward, so beautifully,—so
unguidably! Emblem of much, and of our Age of Hope itself;
which shall mount, specifically-light, majestically in this same manner;
and hover,—tumbling whither Fate will. Well if it do not, Pilâtre-like,
explode; and <i>de</i>mount all the more tragically!—So, riding on windbags,
will men scale the Empyrean.’</p>

<p>The comments of the Parisian wits were of a different order to the
caustic satire of Carlyle: in the engraving by Sargent, which appeared in
all the glory of printed colour, a learned but absent-minded physicist,
instead of inflating his silken globes, inflates himself with the result
that he disappeared through the window. ‘Mon pauvre oncle,’ exclaims
a young man who exhibits the extreme of grief and despair. A fan leaf
‘à l’oncle’ appears in the Bibliothèque Nationale, having been removed
from a mount. Wright, <i>Caricature History of the Georges</i>, note, p. 545,
says: ‘The ascents in France during the year 1784 were very numerous,
and excited interest even in England.’</p>

<p>Horace Walpole, writing from London on May 7 of the following
year, says: ‘Of conversation, the chief topic is air-balloons; a French
girl, daughter of a dancer, has made a voyage into the clouds, and was
in danger of falling to earth, and being <i>ship wrecked</i>. Three more
balloons sail to-day; in short, we shall have a prodigious navy in the air,
and then what signifies having lost the empire of the ocean?’</p>

<p>Beaumarchais’ comedy, <i>Le Mariage de Figaro</i>, upon its production
in Paris in 1784, immediately became the rage, and enjoyed its successful
run of a ‘hundred nights.’ Its story supplied the ‘book’ for Mozart’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">Pg 216</a></span>
opera, which had been ‘commanded’ by the Emperor (Joseph <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>) of
Germany. This work, first produced in Vienna at the time when Italian
opposition to German opera as represented by Gluck and Mozart waxed
fiercest, failed, being so indifferently performed under the direction of
Salieri, the head of the opposing faction. At Prague, however, where it
was subsequently given, and which was outside the influence of Salieri,
it was completely successful, a circumstance which afforded Mozart so
much satisfaction that he declared that he would write an opera for the
good people of Prague, and thereupon produced <i>Don Giovanni</i>!</p>

<p>While the Italian opposition to Mozart’s music was so pronounced,
the feeling of antagonism was by no means reciprocated by the great
Salzburg composer, who wrote a number of variations to airs by Sarti,
Paisiello, and Salieri. The beautiful series of variations on the air ‘Mio
Caro Adone’ from Salieri’s opera, <i>La fiera ai Venezia</i>, was composed
in 1773, the opera appearing in Vienna a year previously.</p>

<p>Two Figaro fans appear in the Schreiber collection, British Museum,
the one with a single medallion in the centre, with scene from the play,
and four stanzas of verse commencing ‘Jadis on voioit Thalie,’ etc.; the
other with a centre medallion and two smaller ones, and thirteen stanzas
of verse commencing ‘Cœurs sensibles, cœurs fidelles,’ etc., with music.
Inscribed at the top—‘Vaudeville du Mariage de Figaro.’ Beaumarchais
collaborated with Salieri in the opera of <i>Tarare</i>, first produced in Paris
in 1787. He claimed to have led the way to the Revolution by this
piece, which formed the subject of several fans.</p>

<p>Three scenes from Grétry’s opera of <i>Richard, Cœur de Lion</i>, first
produced in 1784, and performed the following year before the king and
queen at Fontainebleau, appear on a fan, the costumes being of the period of
the production of the opera, the ladies wearing the hooped petticoat, with
long streamers from their heads. On the reverse, two songs commencing
‘Que le Sultan Saladin,’ and ‘La Danse n’est pas ce que j’aime.’ The song<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">Pg 217</a></span>
‘O Richard, O mon Roi, l’univers t’abandonne,’ which, however, does not
appear on the fan, became of historic importance at Versailles, October 1,
1789.</p>

<p>Other operatic fans commemorate ‘<i>Nina ou la Folle par Amour</i>’ and
‘<i>Raoul de Créqui</i>’ by Dalayrac, produced in 1786 and 1789 respectively.
The first named has a single scene with four figures in the centre of the fan,
and verses headed ‘Romance de Nina, Chantée par Mme. Dugazon.’ The
second much more elaborate, with one large and two smaller panels,
verses and music from the opera on the back of the fan.</p>

<p>Three scenes from Dezède’s <i>Alcidor</i>, produced 1787, commemorate an
opera of which both composer and music are now forgotten. The decorations
are etched and rudely coloured by hand; the sticks walnut, inlaid with ivory.</p>

<p>Three hand-screens appeared with a scene from the first, second, and
third acts respectively of <i>Fanchon La Vielleuse</i>, a French version of Himmel
and Kotzebue’s operetta, <i>Fanchon, das Leyermädchen</i>, produced at Berlin in
1805. These testify to the transient popularity of a now almost forgotten
composer. The screens are of cardboard, coloured grey-brown, shield-shaped,
having an oval medallion engraved in line and coloured by hand.
On the reverse, extracts from the libretto.</p>

<p>Of plays we have an illustration of a scene from Voltaire’s tragedy of
<i>Brutus</i>, first produced in Paris in 1730, and revived in 1790, the names of
the several characters inscribed below the figures.</p>

<p>On another fan, three scenes from Chénier’s play of <i>Charles IX. ou
l’École des Rois</i>, which appeared in Paris in 1789. On the reverse, a long
quotation from the second scene of the third act.</p>

<p>An adventure of Philippe-Égalité, Duc d’Orléans, provided the subject
of several fans. The story is related at length upon a fan which shows
the interior of a cottage where the Duke, during a walk near Bency, in
January 1786, had stopped to ask for a breakfast. The peasant’s wife was at
the point of childbirth, and was actually delivered whilst the unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">Pg 218</a></span>
prince ‘que la France admire’ ate his frugal meal of bread and cheese. With
his natural bonhomie he proposed himself as godfather, and only at the
signing of the register he disclosed his identity by exhibiting his ‘cordon-bleu.’</p>

<p>A fan in the Schreiber collection shows the interior of a parish church,
with the prince standing as sponsor. The inscription, ‘Couplets dédiés à
S.A.S. Monseigneur le Duc d’Orléans.’</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The assembly of notables is duly recorded. We see majesty enthroned
with a royal prince on either side; Monsieur de Calonne reads
his speech, a clerk seated at the table. Inscribed at the top of the fan,
‘L’Assemblée des Notables commencée le 22 Février 1787.’ On the reverse,
the king’s oration, with the extract from that of Monsieur Calonne, together
with a song entitled ‘Ronde Joieuse à l’Occasion de l’Assemblée des
Notables.’<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p>Carlyle thus refers to the popular comments upon this event:—‘The
gaping populace gapes over Wood-cuts or Copper-cuts; where, for example,
a Rustic is represented convoking the Poultry of his barnyard, with this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">Pg 219</a></span>opening address: “Dear animals, I have assembled you to advise me what
sauce I shall dress you with”; to which a Cock responding, “We don’t want
to be eaten,” is checked by “You wander from the point (Vous vous écartez
de la question).” Laughter and logic; ballad-singer, pamphleteer; epigram
and caricature: what wind of public opinion is this—as if the Cave of the
Winds were bursting loose!’</p>

<p>Of the events which immediately preceded and culminated in that of
the 14th July, the fan says little, except in reference to that dread disease
‘consumption of the purse.’ The people have their States-General—the
king is represented as leaning upon a bust of Necker, and holding a cornucopia
from which issues gold; inscribed above, ‘L’Heureuse Union des
trois États Généraux sous le bon plaisir de Louis Auguste <span class="smcap lowercase">XVI.</span> par les
soins de Mr. Necker en 1789.’</p>

<p>On another fan (brisé) the three orders of clergé, noblesse, and Tiers
État appear represented by single figures in medallions.</p>

<p>Of two fans having reference to the enforcement of public contributions
by Necker, one figures Louis and the dauphin standing before an
open box, with a Necker, who has developed wings, opening the box and
abstracting a bag of money: other matters, less significant, appear. On
the other fan is figured a lady and gentleman in a carriage driving
through a wood, with a parcel under the carriage inscribed Contributions;
an officer with a woman riding on the opposite side of the fan, the two
meeting at the junction of the two roads.</p>

<p>And so we reach the lurid 14 Juillet. To describe this siege of the
Bastille passes the talent of mortals; how much more that of the frail
fan!—Of the actual storming, therefore, not a word; we are given instead
a view of the fortress with the white flag floating from the turret.
M. de Launay’s house is in flames, he himself is led between Jamé and
the clock-maker, Hemert, under arrest. Another fan gives us a view of
the Bastille with the drawbridge down, De Launay wringing his hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">Pg 220</a></span>
bemoaning his fate, led prisoner. On the right of the fan are soldiers
headed by Élie with the paper of capitulation on the end of his sword,
two Invalides imploring mercy.</p>

<p>A third fan shows, in a large medallion, a view of the battlements,
with an unfortunate soldier being flung from the height, as De Launay
himself had been threatened. In the foreground De Launay dragged in
custody. The fan (brisé) strung with a tricolour ribbon.</p>

<p>In a fourth fan the Bastille is relegated to the distance, a company
of soldiers drawn up at its gates. In the foreground Liberty is seated
with cap in one hand, and in the other a scroll labelled ‘Époque de la
Liberté.’ Above, a winged figure blowing a trumpet, on the drapery of
which is inscribed ‘Prise a la Bastile le 14 Juilet 1789’; in the right
hand a cockade: the subject forming a medallion mounted in the centre
of an ivory fan cut in fretwork and decorated with trophies, etc., in
gold and colour. An example of this fan was sold at the Walker sale
in 1882. ‘Souvenir de la Bastille’ gives a view of the building with
neighbouring street. ‘Imp et Fabrique d’Eventails Rabiet. J. Ganné
Succ 63 Boul<sup>d</sup> Ménilmontant, Paris. Degovrnay, Éditeur. 28 Rue
Mazarine, Paris.’ On the back—fleurs de lys and Vive le Roy, 1789.</p>

<p>A sixth shows the conquerors issuing from the drawbridge, De Launay
and ‘Le lieutenant’ in great distress; on the reverse the fan sings
‘L’Époque de la Liberté’:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The Bastille has vanished, the fan remaining as souvenir to be sold
for a few sous, and fluttered by the cheek of some light-hearted grisette.
‘Tiens!’ she exclaims, ‘La prise de La Bastille! c’est belle, n’est-ce pas?’
as happily ignorant of the trend of events as majesty in its gilded
chamber. ‘Mais,’ says the poor king, ‘c’est une révolte!’ ‘Sire, it is
not a revolt,—it is a revolution.’</p>

<p>The era of universal liberty has indeed arrived. In ‘Les Droits de
l’Homme, 1789,’ Liberty dons her cap, seats herself upon a pedestal to
be saluted by all good citizens with song, dance, and flowers; the former,
duly inscribed on the fan, commencing ‘Veillons au Salut de l’empire.’</p>

<p>In a variation of this subject La Liberté holds a plummet and triangle
in her right hand, in the other a staff surmounted by a cap of Liberty;
the pedestal inscribed, ‘Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, Unité.’</p>

<p>In a third fan La Liberté becomes ‘Patrone des Français,’ and is still
provided with plummet and cap.</p>

<p>In ‘Le Serment Civique, 1789,’ the attributes only of Liberty appear,
in the shape of three flaming hearts and cap on a flaming altar. Mayor
Bailly and Lafayette take the oath, to the accompaniment of a song
commencing ‘Français, quand je pense à nos maux.’</p>

<p>The Revolution is therefore sanctioned—one of its earliest results
being Le Déménagement du Clergé. On the fan we see a group of
bishops, monks, nuns, a number of servants carrying furniture and other
effects. A bishop, with pipe and bottle, is seated on the top of a baggage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">Pg 222</a></span>wagon
on which is inscribed, ‘J’ai perdu mes bénéfices, Rien n’égale ma
douleur.’ A monk, also smoking, is riding on the horse and flourishing a
flag inscribed, ‘Guidon.’ ‘Messieurs of the Clergy, you <i>have</i> to be
shaved; if you wriggle too much, you will get cut.’<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>In the ‘Désespoir des Pensionnaires,’ we are introduced to a group
of figures who are bewailing their loss; a messenger in cockaded hat is
delivering the notices.</p>

<p>Cockades, indeed, were at this period ‘de rigueur’—the ladies wore
them in front of their head-dresses—wore gauze bonnets trimmed on
either side with them, a great bow of tricoloured streamers at the back.
Stripes everywhere—stripes and cockades, cockades and stripes—stripes
on the dresses, slippers, and even the huge muffs of the women; stripes
on the waistcoats, stockings, and gloves of the men. The patriotic
Frenchmen and Frenchwomen of 1789 were the very incarnation of the
tricolour; it was the symbol of the gospel of the Revolution, Blue of
Liberty, White of Equality, Red of Fraternity.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>The Fête de la Fédération, 1790, is commemorated on a fan giving in
the centre a view of the altar in the Champ de Mars, with Lafayette
waving the tricolour, the fan incribed ‘Le Serment fait sur l’Autel de la
Patrie le 14 Juillet 1790, la voix de Mr. la Fayette, Major de la Confédération
s’est fait entendre au Champ de Mars.’ On either side are busts of
King Louis and Lafayette, inscribed ‘Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XVI.</span>, Roi des Français né à
Versailles le 23 Aoust 1754.’ ‘M. De La Fayette Com. Géné. de la Garde
Nat. Parisienne.’</p>

<p>On another fan the altar, with surrounding booths, arches, etc., and
groups of soldiers dancing. On either side eight verses of a poem, commencing,
‘Voilà la Fête de la Fédération,’ etc., to the air ‘Vive Henri <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>’<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>The ‘Day of Poignards’ (February 28, 1791) approaches, and friends
of Royalty (les chevaliers de poignard) rally round the son of sixty kings.
We all know the issue: chevaliers retreated with greater expedition
than they came—flung ignominiously downstairs into the darkness
of the Tuileries garden, accelerated by ignominious shovings from the
sentries—‘spurnings <i>a posteriori</i>, not to be named.’<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> Our veracious
chronicler the fan provides us with a representation of the scene. The
inscription, ‘Arestation e Désarmement de gens au suspects Ch<sup>au</sup> des
thuileries le 28 F<sup>er</sup> 1791 à 10<sup>h</sup> du soir,’ with six verses of a revolutionary
song, entitled, ‘La Soirée des Poignards,’ the refrain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Quoi l’habit bleu vous fait peur</div>
<div class="line">Valeureux Aristocrates,</div>
<div class="line">Quoi l’habit bleu vous fait peur</div>
<div class="line">Brave ci-devant Seigneur.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The event of the 2nd of April could not pass without the fan’s
comment; we therefore have a medallion profile portrait of Mirabeau,
inscribed, ‘Honoré Gabriel Riquetti, C<sup>te</sup> de Mirabeau. Mort le 2 Avril
1791.’</p>

<p>A second Mirabeau fan, in the possession of M. Philippe de Saint-Albin,
has in the centre a portrait bust, above which is inscribed,
‘Honoré Gabriel Riquetti Mirabeau,’ and ‘Je combattrai les factieux de
tous les partis’; on either side of the portrait two medallions, the
subjects including Mirabeau as tribune, and the great orator on his
deathbed.</p>

<p>Assignat-fans, 1791, refer to the difficulties with respect to paper-money,
the woes of the holders of <i>rentes</i>, when paper-money was not
worth one-tenth of its face value, and draw a contrast between the Dives
of the past and the financier of the present. On the obverse, a medley of
assignats of 1791-2; on the reverse, the two Jeans, the one in ragged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">Pg 224</a></span>clothing and poor surroundings, weeping over his assignats, crying, ‘Ils
sont tombés’ and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Vous êtes Etonnés, je m’en apperçois Bien:</div>
<div class="line">Qu’avec du papier je ne possède Rien’;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>the other, ‘Jean qui Rit,’ the speculator, who exchanges one louis d’or
for 10,000 livres in assignats, is seated at a table with a large coffer and
numerous bags filled with gold. He points to his brother ‘Jean qui
Pleure’ and says, ‘Il se désole,’ and ‘A de certaines gens, je ne me suis
point fié. Ce Résultat pour moi, vaut mieux que du papier.’</p>

<p>On several assignat-fans the money card, the seven of diamonds, is
introduced, its significance being sufficiently obvious.</p>

<p>And royalty in its gilded saloon, what has become of it? How fares
it with the poor Louis and his devoted family? That flight from the Rue
de l’Échelle in the darkness of the night of the 20th June 1791, when the
lady shaded in broad gypsy-hat, tapped, from sheer playfulness, with her
badine—‘light little magic rod such as the Beautiful then wore—the
wheel of Lafayette’s carriage as it rolled past’; this goes unrecorded, as
also the incident in the village of Sainte-Menehould, when Post-master
Drouet recognises a familiar face in the lady with the slouched gypsy-hat
and the ‘Grosse-Tête’ in round hat and peruke. ‘Quick, Sieur Guillaume,
Clerk of the Directoire, bring me a new Assignat! Drouet compares the
Paper-money Picture with the Gross Head in round hat there: by Day and
Night! you might say this one was an attempted engraving of the other.’<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>And so event succeeds event—over the final tragedy of the 21st
January 1793, no less than over the more piteous scene of October 16,
the fan discreetly draws a veil.</p>

<p>Several fans have for their subject the Testament du Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XVI.</span>, and
give medallion portraits of the king and various members of his family,
with the symbol of immortality; the inscription, ‘Testament De Louis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">Pg 225</a></span>Seize, Né Le 23 Aoust 1754. Mort le Lundi 21 Janvier 1793.’ On the
sides or reverse of the fans, the will written out at length.</p>

<p>In ‘Le Songe,’ a female figure is represented asleep; on a tomb in
the centre of the fan, a figure of Louis appears when the fan is placed
against the light; the representation being veiled or concealed by means of
a thin piece of paper pasted over it.</p>

<p>Mourning-fans were common with the more loyal portion of the
community; these also consisted of concealed portraits of Louis and his
family, and are usually decorated with black gauze and spangles; the
inscription, ‘Vive le Roi!’</p>

<p>A favourite device was a pansy or heart’s-ease (‘that’s for thoughts’),
with the portraits appearing on the principal petal, upon the fan being
held against the light. These obtained later, when popular opinion,
becoming tired of the Revolution and its consequences, was again veering
round in the direction of Royalty.</p>

<p>But who is this pale-faced citoyenne of aristocratic mien, in high
‘constitutional’ hat, with black cockade, fan in hand, asking leave to speak
with citizen Marat?... Charlotte’s fan is mentioned in the deposition
of Laurent Bas, who was working in the house at the time; certain it is
that the fan was not relinquished when the blow was struck. The ‘trade,’
fearful lest the event should cast discredit on their goods, immediately
brought out fans ‘à la Marat.’ The most popular of these reproduce
the tribune with Lepelletier, Charlier, and Barras. This, with its burden
of pikes and caps of Liberty, was bought by the Jacobin customers at
forty-eight livres a gross. An example occurs in the Bibliothèque
Nationale, where, singularly enough, it is pasted in an album bearing the
arms of Marie-Antoinette, and is believed to have been arranged by the
queen herself.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p>On another fan, ‘Liberty’ is seated between medallion portraits of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">Pg 226</a></span>Marat and Lepelletier; the inscription, ‘Marat,’ ‘Liberté Unité,’ ‘Peletier.’
Ultimately the event itself figured as the principal subject of a fan,
Charlotte being represented as carrying a dagger in one hand and a fan
in the other.</p>

<p>The debate on the 4th February 1794 on the abolition of the slave-trade
forms the subject of a fan (illustrated). Three years previously,
Grégoire and Robespierre had passed an act whereby coloured persons
born of free parents were placed on an equality with whites. The
fan-makers, ever ready to seize upon a popular incident, promptly issued
a fan with five figures, representing ‘France,’ ‘Mercury,’ ‘The Colonies,’
‘England,’ and the ‘United States,’ holding scrolls with inscriptions
in English, heraldic devices on either side. La France, with shield
bearing staff of Unity and cap of Liberty, is saying, ‘We find true
happiness but by making others happy.’ Mercury, holding fetters, says,
‘Don’t go to deceive me nor believe you will escape. I extend my
power over Sea and Land, and my vengeance will find you even at the
end of the World.’ ‘The Colonies,’ dressed after the fashion of Marmontel’s
Incas, exclaims, ‘Charming hope of Liberty, come and comfort my
agitated heart.’ England, crowned, with a leopard crouching at her feet,
and holding ‘The Colonies’ by the hand, says, ‘She offers me Guineas.’
The United States is represented by a black woman, plumed, with a
sheath of arrows over her shoulder; the inscription, ‘Independence and
trade all over the globe.’ The etching is signed ‘Martin.’</p>

<p>Cabriolets had appeared much earlier, and had continued in favour.
These formed the subject of printed as well as painted fans.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> From
Cabriolets it is but a step to Incroyables, who had their incredible cabriolets
as well as their racehorses with slim legs and tails cropped almost to
the root, the fan-makers indulging the public in their new-found Anglomania.
In these curious prints, a number of which were produced by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">Pg 227</a></span>Carl Vernet, everything is incredible—the wheels of the ‘cabs’ incredibly
thin, the seats incredibly high, the figures of both sexes incredibly tall and
attenuated. ‘Cabriolets,’ says Mercier, ‘are made lighter every day to
give increased speed in the race for wealth.... There are now three
things to admire in a fashionable “cab”—the silver body, the wheels, and
the horse; the whole thing, including the owner and his groom, ought
not to weigh more than a good-sized portmanteau.’</p>

<p>Incredibility became the order of the day. The fashionables, who
abhorred the Revolution, adopted an incredible method of demonstrating
their sentiments; hair was cut incredibly short behind, as it had been
cut for the victims of the scaffold during the reign of terror. Further
to recall the scene, they let it fall as at the moment of execution over
their eyes, this being the style <i>à la victime</i>. A <i>balle des victimes</i> was
given by its votaries, to which no woman was admitted who had not
had a relative guillotined.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p>Once again assignat-fans made their appearance: upon the death
of the Republic and the birth of the Directoire, when the pendulum of
public opinion was once more swinging in the direction of Royalism,
the assignats being arranged so that the king’s head appeared in the
centre of the fan. These, with defiant glances, were fluttered under the
noses of the police by the fair aristocrats of the Palàis Égalité.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>Then came the period of the worship of Nature and the triumph of
Rousseau, with the cry of ‘Long live the author of <i>Émile, Le Contrat
Social, La Nouvelle Héloïse</i>!’, Jean-Jacques being glorified in a triumphal
car drawn by two bullocks garlanded with roses.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>During the temporary lull by which every storm is followed, the
preternaturally high-waisted ladies banished ennui by devotion to the Love-God;
and we have many ‘<i>Ruses de l’Amour</i>’, ‘<i>Triomphes de l’Amour</i>,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">Pg 228</a></span></p>

<p>etc. Cagliostro had some years previously departed <i>pour ‘l’Isle de Malthe.’</i>
Marat, Danton, Robespierre, had been severally removed from the scene
of their activities: the fan-makers were at the point of despair at the
absence of a new sensation, when—enter <i>le petit Caporal!!!</i></p>

<p>Among the myriad fans recording the multifarious activities of this
amazing personality,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> we have a representation of Wurmser surrendering
his sword to the young general, a small medallion on either side of the
battle, and a view of the city: the inscription, ‘A Buonaparte Vienen.’
The border, formed of the word ‘Buonaparte’ in large capitals surrounded
by rays of light, these alternated by laurel wreaths; the fan excellently
engraved by Bertaux.</p>

<p>At the psychological moment of Bonaparte’s appearance at the banquet
given in his honour at the ‘Salle d’audience, 10 Dec. 1797.’ his ‘star,’
in the shape of the planet Venus, appeared in the heavens at midday.
Here indeed was an opportunity for the fan-makers, who promptly produced
a fan of an astrologer with telescope, surrounded by an excited crowd, who
declared the appearance to be a comet. This, says Henri Bouchot, gave
the signal to the Agréables who dressed themselves and their hair
<i>à la comète, à l’étoile</i>, and showered stars in all directions.</p>

<p>We also have a reference to the proposals of peace to the allied
powers by Napoleon on his elevation as First Consul in 1799. Bonaparte
is here crowned by Fame and Peace; points to a map of Europe held
by a figure of the French Republic, who also bears the tricolour inscribed,
‘Nouvelles Républiques, Règne des Arts, Alliance avec les Français.’
From a pedestal the French cock utters its clarion note. To the left,
Victory inscribes on a monument the names of Napoleon’s generals.
Above in a glory the legend, ‘Paix Glorieuse An <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>’</p>

<p>On another fan referring to the same event, Napoleon is discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">Pg 229</a></span>standing by a figure of Peace who bears the olive branch; the inscription,
‘Bonaparte et La Paix.’ Right and left are figures of Commerce and
Agriculture, and in the background a group of peasants express their joy.</p>

<p>In the really handsome fan engraved in stipple by Godefroy we have
an apotheosis of Bonaparte. A bust of the Emperor within an oak wreath
occupies the centre, with the genii of Immortality and Plenty bearing their
attributes; on either side, allegories of Peace and War in medallions
associated with arabesque. The inscription, ‘Dessiné Par Chaudet, Fontaine
et Persier; Gravé Par Godefroy.’<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>The great ‘Descente en Angleterre, 1803,’ forms the subject of a
number of fans. Napoleon, to the accompaniment of Fame’s trumpet and
the rataplan of the drum-major, shows his troops the Channel, and points
to St. Paul’s(!) and the Tower (French version), on an island.</p>

<p>The Channel is tunnelled (in imagination), troops pour through with
ammunition, cannon, and other paraphernalia of war. Above, a fleet
of vessels on the sea, and an army of balloons in the air, invade the
devoted island, which defends itself by means of captive kites, sky rockets,
and the guns booming from the fortifications at Dover. This in several
versions.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>The crowning of Napoleon as King of Italy at Milan, on May 23,
1805, is recorded, as also the Peace of Tilsit, 1807, by which Prussia was
stripped of almost half of its territory. On this latter fan, Napoleon, the
Emperor Alexander, and the King of Prussia appear on a raft.</p>

<p>In 1810 the Emperor, in all the bravery of feathers, leads the Archduchess
Marie-Louise to the altar of Hymen; La France offering a diadem of stars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">Pg 230</a></span></p>

<p>Of fans referring to the Russian campaign of 1812 two appear in the
Schreiber collection. In the one, Napoleon is seen on horseback, attended
by a general, surveying his army, the troops saluting; in the other, the
journey to Paris in a sledge drawn by three horses at full gallop, Napoleon,
wrapped up in furs, looking back on the wounded and dead lying in the
snow. Both fans inscribed, ‘Aventuras de Bonaparte en Rusia en 1812.’</p>

<p>In the subject of the Nicaragua Canal the fan assumes the role of
prophet, and with this we must bring to a close this brief carnival of a
century. On the 12 Vendémiaire of the year <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>, one Martin la Bastide
deposited in the Bibliothèque Nationale two prints of a fan setting forth his
scheme for uniting two oceans through the lake of Nicaragua. He had
already made the suggestion twelve years previously in Laborde’s <i>Histoire
abrégée de la mer du Sud</i>.</p>

<p>He was not, however, the first to demonstrate the feasibility of cutting
a canal at Nicaragua; a similar proposal had been made by the Portuguese
navigator, Antonio Galvão, as early as 1550, and in the following year the
Spanish historian, Gómara, submitted a memorial to Philip <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, urging in
forcible terms that the work be undertaken forthwith. ‘The project was,
nevertheless, opposed by the Spanish Government, who concluded that a
monopoly of communication with their possessions in the New World was
of greater importance than a passage by sea to Cathay.’<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>Two fans referring to this subject appear in the Schreiber collection; in
the one, the map of Central America on the front, and of North America
on the reverse, a portion missing: and in the other, the composition
complete. The fan is adorned with, on the left, a group of allegorical
figures of the four Regions of the world listening to Mercury, the god of
commerce, who points out the course of the proposed canal; on the right, a
reference to La Bastide’s appeal to the King of Spain, who is here listening
to the voice of France urging him to complete the canal; and an elaborate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">Pg 231</a></span>border of ships, tritons, etc., with a summary of La Bastide’s investigations.
Alas for vain hopes, and the futility of human endeavour, the
best laid schemes are often doomed to disappointment, and it was not
until nearly a century had elapsed that the canal, which La Bastide foresaw,
though as through a glass darkly, had any prospect of realisation.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<h3>ENGRAVED FANS OF THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH
CENTURIES. PART II.</h3>

<p><span class="figleft150" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_464.jpg" width="150" height="180" alt="" /></span>
IN England the fan’s comments on the public
events of the eighteenth and the latter years
of the preceding century begin with a satirical
allusion to the intrigues of European diplomacy
concerning the affairs of Poland. Ten
female figures representing France, Spain,
Sardinia, Empire, Saxony, Russia, Poland,
Britannia, Holland, and Prussia are seated
round a table, the first seven playing piquet; an empty chair, labelled
‘I pray to God for peace,’ is reserved for the Pope (Innocent XI.), who is
seen on the left protesting that he does not understand the game. A
figure in civilian dress in the foreground is holding a scroll which is
lettered, ‘’Tis not the interest of the nation to play without advantage. In
time Commerce might pay the cards.’ On the extreme right is the
Sultan of Turkey on horseback, exclaiming, ‘If you don’t leave off, I’ll
tear the cards,’ with the Shah of Persia on foot, saying, ‘Seigneur Jack,
Persia shall make you change your note.’ The date is between 1679 and
1689, the period of the pontificate of Pope Innocent <span class="smcap lowercase">XI</span>.</p>

<p>The coronation banquet of George II. in Westminster Hall, on October
11, 1727, is recorded in an extremely primitive etching. The king and
queen are enthroned on a daïs in the centre of the fan; in the background
are galleries of spectators, and in front the champion of England throws
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">Pg 233</a></span>down his gauntlet. The subject is enclosed in a cartouche, and on the
sides of the fan are the crown, sceptre, ampulla, vestments, etc.; the
whole rudely coloured by hand.</p>

<p>It was, possibly, as some recompense for its author’s gallant defence of
their most powerful weapon that the ladies helped to swell the tide of
prosperity of the <i>Beggar’s Opera</i>, produced in November of this same
year (1727). Fans were carried illustrating the favourite songs of the
piece, which enjoyed its successful run of sixty-three nights, ‘making
Gay rich and Rich gay.’</p>

<p>The defeat and withdrawal of Sir Robert Walpole’s excise scheme
provided the occasion for many satires which appeared during the year
1733. In these Walpole is represented as an itinerant quack doctor, and
as an exciseman, in which latter character he was hanged and burned
in effigy on April 12th of the same year.</p>

<p>In the fan a comparison is drawn between Walpole and Wolsey, and
on a medallion portrait of the last named is inscribed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Wolsey and his Successor here in one behold.</div>
<div class="line">Both serv’d their masters, both their Country Sold.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A figure is seen walking in a garden with two papers in his hands, the
one inscribed, ‘Liberty and Property,’ and the other, ‘No Dutch Politicks.
Down with the Excise.’ In the mid-distance a figure holds a purse and
draws attention to the portrait of Wolsey. Two barrels are figured in the
foreground, together with the Excise Monster in the throes of death, on the
body of which are inscribed the various articles affected, as Printing, Salt,
Malt, Gin, etc.</p>

<p>The print has apparently been cut down, and evidently forms part of
a design or series of designs.</p>

<p>M. Gamble advertises as follows in the <i>Craftsman</i> of June 9, 1733:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘This day is published for all Loyal Ladies, an Excise Fan; or the Political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">Pg 234</a></span>
Monster as described in <i>Fog’s Journal</i>, May the 5th, curiously delineated, Being a
Memorial for Posterity. In this most agreeable fan is represented:</p>

<p>‘I. A Picture of Cardinal Wolsey (the first Excise Master of England) done
from an original Painting.</p>

<p>II. A view of his Feats on one Hand, and those of his Successor on the
other.</p>

<p>III. An English Lawyer with two honest Briefs.</p>

<p>IV. The famous Monster-Monger, Ferdinando Ferdinandi, drawn to the
Life.</p>

<p>V. The Death of the Excise Monster.</p>

<p>VI. A modern Inquisition with an Assembly of Merry Spectators (as Vintners,
Tobacconist, etc.) of Ferdinando’s Lamentation over his departed Beast.</p></blockquote>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Now!</div>

</div></div></div>

<blockquote>
<p>‘Sold by M. Gamble at the Golden Fan in St. Martin’s Court near Leicester
Fields. Price 2s. 6d.’</p></blockquote>

<p>On August 25 of the same year, M. Gamble again advertises the fan
and adds:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘This is the Fan mentioned in the <i>London Magazine</i>; it will be very useful at all
meetings for nominating Members of Parliament, not only for cooling the Heats which
may arise, but to show the nature of an arbitrary Monster.</p></blockquote>

<div class="line i04">‘Now is the Time when every British Fair</div>

<blockquote>
<p>‘There is now published the third Edition with additions.’</p></blockquote>

<p>The marriage of the Crown Princess with the Prince of Orange in 1734
was the occasion of much rejoicing, and the nuptials were celebrated with
the greatest magnificence, the prince receiving with his bride the sum of
£80,000 as portion. In an address to His Majesty from the loyal and
dutiful citizens of London, the greatest glory, the brightest triumphs,
the most distinguished prosperity are presaged from another alliance
with that truly illustrious house, the house of Nassau; ‘from whence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">Pg 235</a></span>
so many heroes have sprung, the scourges of tyrants and the asserters
of liberty.’</p>

<p>The fan joins in the general congratulatory chorus; a view of the
marriage ceremony in the French Chapel of St. James’s Palace is given; the
King and Queen, with the royal family, are seated in boxes at the back.</p>

<p>There was an allegorical version of this event, in which the contracting
parties appear in classic costume, with a bishop and other persons in the
background in the costume of the period. In front Hymen lights his torch
from that of Cupid. In other parts of the composition are seen: An infant
embracing a lamb, a pelican in her piety, an infant Hercules killing serpents,
etc. The whole surrounded by an orange border.</p>

<p>Several variations of this are extant, one omitting the orange-trees, with
a border printed from another plate.</p>

<p>The following advertisement appeared in the <i>Craftsman</i> for July 7,
1733:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘<i>Just Published</i></p>

<p>‘By <span class="smcap">Jonathan Pinchbeck</span>, Fanmaker, at the Fan and Crown in New Round
Court in the Strand; and sold by him, and at the Fan-shops of London and Westminster.</p>

<p>‘The Nassau Fan; or Love and Beauty Triumphant: Being an Encomium on the
Nuptial Ceremony which will shortly be consummated between his Highness the
Prince of Orange and the Princess Royal of England; adorned with the Pictures of
those illustrious Personages, attended by Hymen, Fame, Minerva, Cupids, etc.
Together with a copy of Verses and other Decorations suitable to the occasion.</p>

<p>‘<i>N.B.</i>—Beware of Counterfeits; the true original Nassau Fans having the name
(Pinchbeck) prefix’d to the mount.’</p></blockquote>

<p>On August 18th this advertisement is repeated, with the additional
statement that ‘there are a few neatly printed on leather for the curious,’
and a note to the following effect:—‘A spurious edition of the Nassau Fan
has been lately offer’d to the publick, in Prejudice to the Original Nassau
Fan; but as all Persons that have seen both are fully satisfy’d that it bears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">Pg 236</a></span>
no comparison with the former, ‘tis no wonder that the Design to lessen the
original in the esteem of the Publick, proves as fruitless as the Attempt is
unfair and ungenerous’; this evidently referring to the following, which had
appeared in the <i>Craftsman</i> a week earlier, August 11:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘<i>This day is Published</i></p>

<p>‘The New Nassau Fan, humbly dedicated to her Royal Highness <span class="smcap">Princess
Anne</span>,</p>

<p>
By her Highness’s most humble<br />
and devoted servant,<br />
<span class="smcap">Richard Hylton</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>‘In this fan is represented the Portraitures of his Highness William, Prince of
Orange and Nassau, etc., and her Royal Highness Princess Anne (done from the
original Painting of Van Dyke and Hysing), in an Orbit, supported by Cupids,
adorn’d with other emblematical Ornaments, disposed in a curious and beautiful
Manner.</p>

<p>‘To be had of the aforesaid Richard Hylton, at the Golden Fan in Great George
St., Hanover Square.’</p></blockquote>

<p>On September 1st this advertisement is repeated, with the addition of
the following couplet:—</p>

<p>
‘Just Heaven does Anne and Nassau joyn,<br />
To glad great George and Caroline.’<br />
</p>

<p>And the following reply to Pinchbeck’s advertisements of 7th July and 18th
August:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘<i>N.B.</i>—This is to inform that ingenious Gentleman (who calls himself) the
Proprietor of a Nassau Fan, that he has been guilty of a very gross Error, and has
prejudiced himself by informing the Publick that he knows no Difference between
a Fan which is made like the Frontispiece of a Halfpenny Ballad, and one that’s
done in a curious Manner by one of the best Hands in England.’</p></blockquote>

</tr></table></div>

<p>This sally calls forth the following rejoinder from Pinchbeck, who, on
September 15th, repeats his former advertisement, with this footnote:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘<i>N.B.</i>—I would not have the splenetick Author of (as he calls it) the loyal Nassau
Fan imagine that I think him capable either of doing, or saying, any Thing Worthy of
Notice, tho’ for once I condescend to inform him that the Publick are sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">Pg 237</a></span>convinc’d of his Ignorance in putting his Trifle in Competition with the Original
Nassau Fan, as well as of his Malice in perverting the Sense of my Advertisement.
I shall, however, submit my Performance to the judgment of the Publick, and not
trouble them with quackish Epistles quite foreign to the Purpose.</p>

<p>‘Beware of Counterfeits. The Original Nassau Fan having the name
(Pinchbeck) prefix’d to the Mount.’</p></blockquote>

<p>On September 22nd, Pinchbeck repeats his advertisement, and once
again cautions the public against counterfeits. (In the highest esteem
among the Ladies, and infinitely surpasseth every Thing of the Kind
offered to the Publick.)</p>

<p>A month earlier a fresh candidate for public favour had appeared in
the shape of the ‘Orange Fan,’ a composition of an orange-tree and a
rose-bush, with a view of London in the distance, a three-masted vessel
in the foreground, and above, a dove holding in his beak a letter addressed
‘To The Lovely She, Who has more than 80,000 Charms’; on the upper
and lower border of the fan, an ode in five stanzas, ‘set to Music: Tune,
Let’s be Jolly; fill our Glasses.’</p>

<p>This was advertised by M. Gamble in the <i>Craftsman</i> for August
25th, the charms of the ‘Lovely She’  being reduced in the advertisement
to 30,000.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Once more the Orange joins the British Rose,</div>

<p>The ‘New Nassau Fan,’ advertised by Hylton, is here given, and
must certainly be said to bear very fair comparison with Pinchbeck’s.
The portraits of the royal pair occupy a medallion in the centre, supported
by Cupids above; two winged figures are holding a wreath and
blowing trumpets, from which are suspended the royal arms of the two
respective countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">Pg 238</a></span></p>

<p>Below is a ribbon inscribed, ‘Ad Altiora Speramus,’ with a Cupid
holding a royal crown and star. A scroll, at the extremities of which are
two medals of George II. and William the Silent, Prince of Orange, is
inscribed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>In addition are figures of Peace with olive branch and dove, and
Liberty holding cap on a staff, together with a Bible inscribed ‘B. Sacra,’
a lion at her feet.</p>

<p>The fan is freely etched, coloured by hand, and mounted on plain
wavy wooden sticks.</p>

<p>Pinchbeck continued to advertise his fan until April 20, 1734,
when, presumably, popular interest in the affair waned.</p>

<p>In 1730-33, Hogarth produced his ‘Harlot’s Progress’ (commenced at
the time of his marriage), its various scenes being promptly pirated by the
fan-makers. Mr. F. G. Stephens, in his <i>Catalogue of Political and Personal
Satires</i>, British Museum, vol. iii. part I, page 28, refers to fans printed
with copies from ‘A Harlot’s Progress,’ three designs being on each side of
the fan, usually printed in red ink. These fans, says Nichols, Hogarth’s
biographer, were customarily given to the maid-servants in Hogarth’s
family, doubtless as moral lessons.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> M. Gamble had advertised them
during the year 1733 in the <i>Craftsman</i> and <i>Daily Journal</i>. In a footnote
to his advertisement of the Church of England fan we have the following:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>N.B.</i>—‘For those that are Curious, a small number are work’d off on fine Paper,
fit to Frame. Likewise a new Edition of the ‘Harlot’s Progress’ in Fans, or singly to
Frame.’—<i>Daily Journal</i>, Jan. 24, 1733.</p></blockquote>

<p>By the kindness of Mr. C. Fairfax Murray we are enabled to illustrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">Pg 239</a></span>an excellent example of one of these very rare fan leaves, inscribed in ink
(probably by the collector Baker), ‘Given to me by Mrs. Hogarth, 1781.’
In the centre is the quack doctor, printed in a greenish yellow, the two
side scenes of ‘Bridewell’ and the ‘Funeral’ in a rich red, the fan being
engraved in pure line. The scenes are inscribed respectively—‘In a high
Salivation’; ‘In Bridewell beating of Hemp’; and the ‘Funeral’; with
suitable explanatory verses.</p>

<p>Other fans were issued, these probably by another publisher, giving the
various scenes grouped together, the figures slightly rearranged to suit
the space, indifferently etched in outline, and printed in red on skin. Five
leaves appear in the Schreiber collection; the first gives the whole composition;
the second, the same, with several scenes omitted; the third, with
further omissions; the fourth, with the central subject only, of the arrival of
‘Mary Hackabout in London,’ partially coloured by hand; the fifth, a
spoiled, indistinct print, covered with a Chinese landscape printed in black,
the evident intention being to utilise the skin mount.</p>

<p>The print of the Midnight Modern Conversation, 1733, copied by salt-glazed
potters of the period, and appearing on snuff-boxes and punch-bowls,
for the latter of which it was eminently suitable, was used also for a
fan mount.</p>

<p>In this print, to quote Mr. Austin Dobson, a party of eleven, whose
degrees of intoxication are admirably differentiated, have finished some two
dozen bottles of claret; and at four in the morning are commencing a
capacious bowl of punch, presided over by a rosy-gilled parson—the</p>

both with the famous ‘Orator’ Henley, and the Rev. Cornelius Ford, a
dissolute cousin of Dr. Johnson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">Pg 240</a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>Daily Journal</i> for May 24, 1733, we have the following
advertisement:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘<i>This Day is Published</i>,</p>

<p>‘A Beautiful Mount for a Fan, call’d the Midnight Modern Conversation, curiously
performed from that incomparable Design of that celebrated Artist the ingenious Mr.
Hogarth; to which is prefixed, for the Entertainment of the Ladies, a Description of
each particular Person that Gentleman hath introduced in that Night Scene. Sold at
Mr. Chinavax’s great Toyshop against Suffolk-street, Charing Cross; Mr. Deard’s
against St. Dunstan’s Church, Fleet Street; Mrs. Cambal in St. Martin’s Court; and by
B. Dickinson at Inigo Jones’ Head against Exeter Change in the Strand, at which
Place they may be had Wholesale at reasonable Rates.’</p></blockquote>

<p>No print of this fan-mount is available for reproduction.</p>

<p>The victory of Admiral Vernon in his good ship the <i>Burford</i> at
Portobello, on the 22nd November 1739, though not a particularly
significant feat even with six ships of the line, was immensely popular
with the masses. It was a familiar subject with the potters, especially
the Staffordshire potter Astbury, who commemorated it on tea-pots,
mugs, and the Portobello bowl.</p>

<p>The fan is not very interesting as a design, the six ships appearing
to overpower the fortress, which was an old one. Five stanzas of verse
appear, expressing the determination to avenge the wrongs of Britons, to
support her injured trade, etc.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">Pg 241</a></span></p>

<p>The etching is signed ‘F. Chassereau, April y<sup>e</sup> 22, 1740.’</p>

<p>Vernon’s exploit at Carthagena, April 1, 1740, is also recorded; on the
left, a view of the English camp; on the right, the flying inhabitants,
including a figure named ‘Don Blas’; the fan inscribed ‘Cartagena.’</p>

<p>The motion by Mr. Sandys in the House of Commons on January 29,
1740, and that of Lord Carteret in the House of Lords on February 13,
1741, to remove Sir Robert Walpole (who at that time was exceedingly unpopular)
from his post of Prime Minister, is commemorated on a fan which
is a free copy from a print published by T. Cooper at the Globe in
Paternoster Row, 1741, and referred to in a letter of Horace Walpole,
written from Florence to his friend Conway, March 25, 1741: ‘I have
received a print by this post that diverts me extremely: <i>the Motion</i>.
Tell me, dear, now, who made the design, and who took the likenesses:
they are admirable; the lines are as good as one sees on such occasions.
I wrote last post to Sir Robert, to wish him joy; I hope he received my
letter.’</p>

<p>The scene is Whitehall, with the Treasury in the distance. A coach
containing Lord Carteret, who is leaning out of the window and crying,
‘Let me get out,’ is driven by the Duke of Argyll, brandishing a flaming
sword, the Earl of Chesterfield as postilion. Bubb Dodington, in the form
of a spaniel, is seated between the Duke’s legs. Lord Cobham behind as
footman. Lord Lyttelton follows on horseback, whip in hand. Several
persons are being overridden by the coach, which is nearly overturned.
Mr. Sandys, in the foreground, is dropping the ‘Place Bill,’ and exclaiming,
‘I thought what would come of putting him on the box.’
Pulteney, exclaiming, ‘Z—nds! they’re over,’ and leading his followers
by the nose, wheels a barrow laden with ‘Craftsman,’ ‘Letters to the
Earl,’ ‘State of Nat—’, ‘Champion,’ ‘Common Sense,’ etc., with a dice
box and dice. Dr. Smalbroke, Bishop of Lichfield, accompanied by three
pigs (one only in the original print), bows obsequiously.</p>

<p>The ten verses which appeared on the print are inscribed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">Pg 242</a></span>
right hand of the fan. In ‘nigger’ parlance they at once propound questions
and supply the answers, thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Who be dat de Box do sit on?</div>
<div class="line i04">‘Tis John, the Hero of North Britain,</div>

<div class="line i15">Doodle, etc.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thomas Wright (<i>Caricature History of the Georges</i>) thus refers to the
prints: ‘Several editions of “The Motion” were published, and one, in the
collection of Mr. Burke, is fitted for a fan. Another, very neatly drawn and
etched on a folio plate, and dated February 19th, contains great variations,
and wants much of the pointed meaning of the genuine print. They here
appear to be driving into a river. Pulteney and Sandys are omitted; two
prelates hold on to the straps behind the coach, which seems in imminent

so fast, you’ll overset us all, by G—d.”’</p>

<p>On the 2nd of March the ‘Patriots’ retaliated with a caricature entitled
‘The Reason,’ in which we have another carriage with the portly form of
Sir Robert Walpole as coachman:</p>

<p>In this print, the foppish and effeminate Lord Hervey, well known by
Pope’s sarcastic title of ‘Lord Fanny,’ is riding, fan in hand, on a wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">Pg 243</a></span>
horse, drawn by two men, one of whom cries, ‘Sit fast, Fanny; we are sure

</div></div></div>

<p>The fan-makers were not slow in following up with a fan. On April 25,
the following advertisement appeared in the <i>Craftsman</i>:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘This day is published, by J. Pinchbeck at the Fan and Crown in New Round
Court, in the Strand.</p>

<p>‘The Reason for the Motion. A Satire, whereon are the Portraits of divers Noble
Personages. To which is annexed, Explanatory Verses, which will serve as a Key
to the Whole.</p>

<p>‘Where may be had, All sorts of Fans and Fan-Mounts. The newest fashion,

<p>‘<i>N.B.</i>—Gentlemen and Ladies may have any Device done in a curious Manner,
according to their own Direction.</p>

<p>‘There is a Spurious Sort about the Town, which has not the Verses, and but part
of the Figures.’</p></blockquote>

<p>The Jacobite rebellion of 1745 was commemorated by a fan leaf
engraved by Sir Robert Strange, intended for the sympathisers with the
Pretender. The moment for the rebellion was well chosen—the king was in
Hanover, the Duke of Cumberland had fought and lost Fontenoy in April
of the same year, and was still engaged in Flanders. The fan shows the
Prince in armour, with Cameron of Lochiel as Mars, and Flora Macdonald
as Bellona.</p>

<p>In the fan representing the apotheosis of the Young Pretender, the
Prince, supported by Mars and Bellona, is claiming the inheritance of the
English crown; a figure of Fame bears the laurel wreath, at his side is an
altar blazing with devoted hearts, and above are Venus and Cupid seated on
a cloud. On the left, Britannia smiles through her tears as a dove
approaches bearing the palm branch, emblem of Peace. On the right,
Jupiter with his thunder scatters the Hanoverian faction into obscurity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">Pg 244</a></span>
Rapine and Murder are prostrated. An example, carefully coloured, appeared
in the Walker sale in 1882, and passed into the possession of Lady Charlotte
Schreiber for the sum of £7. The stick is ivory, carved with subjects
and fretwork.</p>

<p>The peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, signed October 7, 1748, was celebrated in
the following April by a grand display of fireworks in the Green Park,
opposite to His Majesty’s library. A fan fairly well engraved, the design
well disposed, shows a view of the temporary building erected for this
purpose, which consisted of a ‘magnificent Doric temple,’ with two
extended wings terminated by pavilions, the whole being one hundred
and fourteen feet high and four hundred and ten feet long. The exhibition
began about nine o’clock in the evening, and was introduced by ‘a grand
overture of warlike instruments composed by Mr. Handel.’ About eleven
o’clock the whole building was illuminated, in which state it continued till
between two and three in the morning; His Majesty and the royal family
retiring about twelve.</p>

<p>The untimely death of the Prince of Wales in 1751 threw London into
mourning, the fan following suit with a portrait bust of Frederick on a
cenotaph, with mourning figures of Art, Science, and Britannia, a figure of
Hope with an anchor occupying the foreground. The fan here, true to
its antecedents, discovers more loyalty than did some of the rhymesters
of the period, one of whom produced an epitaph of which the following
is a portion:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">... ‘Since ‘tis only Fred,</div>
<div class="line">Who was alive and is dead.</div>
<div class="line">There’s no more to be said.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Wolfe’s victory in 1759, commemorated in Bow statuettes and Staffordshire
busts and jugs, supplied the fan-makers also with a subject for illustration:
in a life of Wolfe it is mentioned that fans were printed of the
taking of Quebec.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">Pg 245</a></span></p>

<p>Admiral Rodney is another instance in which both potters and fanmakers
vied with each other in honouring the hero of the hour. The fan in
the Schreiber collection is delicately engraved in mezzotint, and shows
Rodney trampling upon the French and Spanish flags. Neptune is offering
a sea crown, while a Cupid above bears a laurel wreath. The picture is
supplemented by festoons, ribbons, and other devices; the whole coloured
by hand.</p>

<p>The fan abundantly testifies to the popularity of the reigning house of
Hanover. Thus we have, in addition to the loyal fans already referred to,
a medallion portrait of George <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, held in the hand of Neptune, who is
seated in his chariot drawn by four horses, and driven by a Cupid who
blows a blast from a trumpet. This designed by Uwins and engraved
in stipple by Cardon.</p>

<p>The king also appears as the subject of a large medallion on a pedestal
surrounded by Cupids and a figure of Fame with trumpet. In the foreground
are figures of Britannia and Commerce; on a tripod with a flaming
heart is inscribed, ‘The Heart of the Nation.’ On each side the initials
G. R. and the royal crown. Published May 13, 1791, by A. P. Birman, the
fan being signed A. P. Birnam, Inv<sup>t</sup>.; W. Hinks, Sculp<sup>t</sup>. This fan leaf is
a free copy from that engraved by D. Chodowiecki in 1787, commemorating
the accession of Frederick William <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> to the throne of Prussia, and was
made to do duty both for the King and the Duke of York by the alteration
of the bust, and the substitution of the initials D. Y. for G. R., the
arabesques re-engraved.</p>

<p>The royal family appear on six medallion portraits united by a ribbon,
with the royal crown, feathers, and a trophy of arms, flags, etc., the latter
indicating the martial proclivities of the Duke of York.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">Pg 246</a></span></p>
<p>Another fan gives a large Royal Arms surmounted by the crowned lion,
with the rose and thistle and the initials G. R. in medallions on either side,
united by festoons of flowers with doves; the royal motto, ‘Dieu et mon
Droit,’ on a scroll below; the fan inscribed, ‘Vive Le Roy.’ Published by
T. Balster, March 19, 1789.</p>

<p>A ‘Representation of a Royal Concert at Buckingham House’ is a copy
of an engraving by Barlow after a drawing by Cruikshank. ‘Publish’d as
the Act directs, October 16, 1781, by J. Preston at his Music Warehouse,
No. 97, near Beaufort Buildings, Strand.’ In the subject occupying the
centre of the fan, the king appears seated at the right-hand corner. At the
sides, a canone and canzonet by Giordani, together with a French and
Venetian canzonet, with music.</p>

<p>In 1788 the royal family honoured the exhibition of the Royal
Academy with a visit; this event being commemorated on two fans
varying considerably in the number and disposition of the figures, and in
the arrangement of the background. The fan leaf in the Schreiber collection
is designed by ‘P. Ramberg, P. Martini, Sculpt. Pub<sup>d</sup> March 6,
1789, by A. Poggi, St. George’s Row, Hyde Park,’ this being from
Martini’s original plate, also published by Poggi, cut down to the shape
of a fan.</p>

<p>The fan leaf at present in the collection at South Kensington is
printed on vellum and tinted, and is accompanied by an engraved key
to the different personages depicted on the fan.</p>

<p>The marriage of the Prince of Wales (afterwards George <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>) to
Princess Caroline of Brunswick, in 1795, provides the occasion for a fan,
with two oval medallion portraits in stipple of ‘The Illustrious Pair,’ on
either side of a large Prince of Wales’s feathers. ‘Publish’d Jan<sup>ry</sup> 1, 1795,
by J. Read, 133 Pall Mall.’ The same plate was printed in colours and
published on the same date. The ‘Royal Pair’ again appear in the
form of medallion portraits, with the Royal Arms of Great Britain and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">Pg 247</a></span>Brunswick. Still another fan commemorative of this event shows bust
portraits of the prince and princess in the midst of a medley of prints,
riddles, etc., with a frieze of caricature busts of various personages.
‘Published at Sudlow’s Fan Warehouse, 191 Strand.’</p>

<p>‘The Prince of Wales’ (Schreiber collection of unmounted fan leaves,
No. 11) is a quite charming fan leaf. The medallion portrait is printed in
a warm brown, the field of the fan painted in blue of a pleasant quality,
the ornaments painted in silver and Chinese white. This is a scheme of
colour adopted on many fans of the period; the four colours forming
an extremely effective harmony.</p>

<p>The popularity of Lord Howe’s victory over the French on the
‘glorious first of June,’ 1794, is evinced by the frequency with which it
was commemorated on English pottery in the shape of statuettes,
medallions, mugs, jugs, etc. On the fan also we have the subject of a
seated Britannia bearing a medallion portrait of the admiral; the union
jack, lion, cornucopia, and a figure of Fame completing the composition.
The fan inscribed, ‘Lord Howe’s decisive victory over the Grand French
fleet, June 1, 1794.’ This published by B. Coker, 118 Fleet Street,
August 19, 1794. An example occurs in the collection of Mr. Burdett-Coutts.</p>

<p>A ‘view of the trial of Warren Hastings, Esq., at Westminster Hall’
in 1778, is given in the centre of a fan having oval medallions at the
sides with references to the numbers on the engraving, as follows:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘A. Hon<sup>ble</sup> House of Commons. B. Foreign Ministers. C. Duke of Newcastle’s
Gallery. D. Councell for the Prosecution. E. Councell for the Prisoner.
F. Dukes, &amp;c. &amp;c. G. Peeresses. H. Board of Works. I. The Throne.
K. Recess for His Majesty. L. Recess for the Royal Family. M. Judges.
N. Lord High Chancellor. O. Vicounts and Barons. P. Warren Hastings, Esq.,
Prisoner. Q. Committee of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>‘Publish’d as the Act directs by Cock &amp; Co., No. 36 Snow Hill. Sept<sup>r.</sup> 22<sup>nd,</sup>
1788.’</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">Pg 248</a></span></p>

<p>Church-fans appeared in the early part of the century.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> These
were designed for the purpose of inculcating the spirit of true piety
during the hours of divine worship. Comments were made in the public
journals on the unsuitable character of fan mounts used in church, and
also on the general behaviour of persons of both sexes. These culminated
in an amusing satire which appeared in the form of a letter from Vetustus,
in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for May 1753. In this the writer expresses
some surprise that ‘in the course of the controversy now on foot concerning
the expedience of a revision of our liturgy, no mention has been
made of some ceremonies introduced by certain polite persons of both
sexes, who, if they may not be styled the <i>pillars</i>, have undoubted right
to be called the <i>ornaments</i> of the Church of England. That of the snuff-box
may be allowed to obviate some part of the objection to the <i>length</i>
of the service, since it precludes the drowsy members of the congregation
from any subterfuge in that excuse of Horace:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Operi longo fas est obrepere somnum.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The writer desires also ‘to do a piece of justice to the ladies who have
lately contrived to improve the service of the Church, though by so
inconsiderable an implement as a fan mount; for, reflecting that some
of the grosser sex may probably come to church chiefly on account of
these fair beings, and that the devotion of these their brethren might cool
by having the immediate object of it withdrawn from their view, during
the tedious intervals of prayer, they have been so charitable as to
supply them with some edifying subjects of contemplation, depicted on
the very cloud which intercepts the beatific vision.’</p>

<p>As an instance of the taste and discretion of these fair votaries, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">Pg 249</a></span>list is subjoined of a dozen designs elegantly executed, which were
actually displayed by way of screens to so many pretty faces, disposed
in a semicircular arrangement about the holy table:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Darby and Joan, with their attributes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Harlequin, Pierrot, and Columbine.</p>

<p class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The Prodigal Son with his harlots, copied from the ‘Rake’s
Progress.’</p>

<p class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;4. A rural dance, with a band of musick, consisting of a fiddle, a
bag-pipe, and a Welch-harp.</p>

<p class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The taking of Porto Bello.</p>

<p class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The Solemnities of a Filiation.</p>

<p class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Joseph and his Mistress.</p>

<p class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;8. The humours of Change-Alley.</p>

<p class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Silenus, with his proper symbols and supporters.</p>

<p class="indent">10. The first interview of Isaac and Rebecca.</p>

<p class="indent">11. The Judgment of Paris.</p>

<p class="indent">12. Vauxhall Gardens, with the decorations and company.</p></blockquote>

<p>The writer is ‘well aware that the authors of the free and candid
disquisitions will be humbly suggesting, in their canting way, whether
some of these figures may be altogether suitable to the original design
of that sacred rite, at which they assist on these occasions; and whether,
if our British ladies are too nicely modest to worship God with naked
faces, they should not return to the ancient simplicity of a plain linnen
or Sarcenet veil, after the manner of the Jewish females. But, besides
that all impropriety is absolutely removed from these representations
by the mixture of so much Scripture history, these Cavillers must be
told that this is an old objection answered and baffled long ago by
the pious and conscientious Dr. Swift (whose tender concern for the
honour of the Church of England is well known) in a religious sonnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">Pg 250</a></span>
which closes with an elevated sentiment couched in the following
couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“How beauteous is the Church, which makes clean linnen</div>
<div class="line">As decent to repent in, as to sin in.”’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This bone of contention, apparently, lasted during a considerable period.</p>

<p>In the <i>Lady’s Magazine</i> for March 1776, a ‘Female Reformer’
addresses to the fair sex some ‘moral reflections’ on ladies’ fans, and draws
attention to the loose, almost indecent, mounts ladies have to their fans
at the present day, giving too much reason to suppose that a coarse,
indelicate, and immodest picture is not so offensive to the view of the fair
as prudence, virtue, and chastity could wish. ‘Not many Sundays ago,
I was seated in a dissenting place of worship in the next pew to two young
ladies, who appeared suitably attentive and devout; but, happening to cast
my eyes on the fan mount of the youngest of the two, as she stood up
in prayer time, I was really ashamed to see <i>naked Cupids, and women
almost so</i>, represented as sleeping under trees, while dancing shepherds
and piping fawns compleated the shameful groupe. What a pity it is
that any lady should seem to countenance immodesty or indecency in the
least degree, especially in the house of God! Would it not have been
much better for ladies to have no fans at all, than to have such mounts
to them, as, on beholding, tend only to inflame the passions, and promote
the loosest ideas?’</p>

<p>Evidently this protest bore good fruit, as, three months later, a
church-fan of chaste design appeared. This gives, in the centre, a diagram
of a good woman’s heart, divided, as a phrenological diagram divides the
brain, into the several virtues or attributes, as Charity, Humility, Chastity
and Honour, Virtue and Truth, etc. etc. Above the heart appears a
drapery inscribed, ‘The Address of a Scripture Looking-glass to every
Woman’—this consisting of the following texts: Proverbs xxxi. 30;
1 Peter iii. 3; 1 Timothy iv. 8. At the two extremities of the fan are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">Pg 251</a></span>
scrolls with ‘a description of a good woman,’ and a poem entitled ‘The
Wish’—this latter being a prayer and supplication to the Almighty to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i3">‘Be the guardian of the virtuous fair,</div>
<div class="line">Bless them with all things that they truly need,</div>
<div class="line">And in Religion’s paths their footsteps lead.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The whole design enclosed in a scroll with a rose and honeysuckle
filling the intervening spaces. Printed, as the Act directs, for J. French,
No. 17 Holborn Hill.</p>

<p>In May 1796 ‘the new church-fan’ appears, a much more pretentious
design, engraved in stipple, and ‘published with the Approbation
of the Lord Bishop of London.’ The Ten Commandments are given in
the centre, with the Lord’s Prayer and the Creed on either side; these are
alternated with medallions of angels, above which are prayers for the king’s
majesty and the royal family. At the extreme top of the fan is a figure
of the Holy Spirit with three cherubs, the whole being enclosed within
an elaborate border formed of royal crowns and Prince of Wales’s
feathers.</p>

<p>Mindful of the protest of the ‘Female Reformer’ in the <i>Lady’s
Magazine</i>, although perhaps somewhat belated (it will be remembered
that the ‘naked Cupids and ladies almost so’ were observed in a <i>dissenting</i>
place of worship), the ‘<i>chapel</i>-fan’ appears, in July of this same year,
1796, having in the centre a large medallion of the resurrection of a pious
family, after a picture by the Rev. W. Peters, inscribed, ‘Glory to God
in the Highest,’ and on either side smaller medallions representing
‘St. Cecilia’ and ‘The Infant Samuel at Prayer.’ The fan is further
inscribed with a morning and evening prayer and two hymns—‘The
Example of Christ,’ and ‘On Retirement and Meditation.’</p>

<p>A number of fans were from time to time issued with subjects from
Scripture history, doubtless for church use, as ‘The Birth of Esau and
Jacob,’ in which we have an illustration of Rebekah in bed, attended by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">Pg 252</a></span>
female servants; ‘Moses striking the Rock,’ <i>Published by M. Gamble,
according to the late Act</i>, 1740; ‘Paul Preaching at Athens,’ etc. These,
however, are extremely weak productions, exhibiting none of that sense
of character distinguishing similar subjects treated by the Staffordshire
potter of this and a later period.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Osborne’s <i>Duck-Hunting</i> records an event in the
history of a bookseller of Gray’s Inn Gate, Holborn, at his country-house
at Hampstead in 1754. A certain Captain Pratten, who had obtained
some notoriety through his very particular attentions to the wife of Mr.
Scarlett, an optician of Soho, ‘whose Microscope for viewing opake objects
is still in use,’ but who, apparently, did not possess any microscope or
optic glass through which he might view events which were sufficiently
transparent to every one but himself, had proposed to Mr. Osborne
that by way of house-warming he should ingratiate himself with
the families of Hampstead, ‘then a Watering-place and very gay,’ by
giving a public breakfast for the ladies and a duck-hunting for the
gentlemen.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 10th of September of the year in question the
company assembled, the broad panniered petticoats of the ladies making
a very brave array, and, the breakfast and duck-hunting proving so
successful, our waggish Captain, who had installed himself master of the
ceremonies, mindful, doubtless, of his own private and particular duck-hunting,
persuaded the vain and simple bookseller to prolong the entertainment,
first by a cold collation and other diversions, and finally by a dance,
in which the ‘younger part of the company tripped on the light fantastic
toe till bedtime.’</p>

<p>As a souvenir of the event, the gallant and resourceful Captain further
persuaded Mr. Osborne to have a fan engraved and presented to each
of the lady visitors.</p>

<p>Conversation- or speaking-fans are devices by which the different motions
of the fan are made to correspond with the letters of the alphabet, a code
being established by means of which a silent and secret conversation is
carried on.</p>

<p>Five signals are given, corresponding to the five divisions of the
alphabet, the different letters, omitting the J, being capable of division into
five, the movements 1 2 3 4 5 corresponding to each letter in each division.
1. By moving the fan with left hand to right arm. 2. The same movement,
but with right hand to left arm. 3. Placing against bosom. 4. Raising it
to the mouth. 5. To forehead.</p>

<p>Example:—Suppose <i>Dear</i> to be the word to be expressed. D belonging
to the first division, the fan must be moved to the right; then, as the number
underwritten is 4, the fan is raised to the mouth. E, belonging to the same
division, the fan is likewise moved to the right, and, as the number underwritten
is 5, the fan is lifted to the head and so forth. The termination of
each word is distinguished by a full display of the fan, and as the whole
directions with illustrations are displayed on the fan, this language is more
simple than at first sight might appear.</p>

<p>The <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for 1740 prints the following effusion, referring
presumably to one of the earliest of these fans:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>‘The Original Fanology, or Ladies’ Conversation fan,’ was invented by
Charles Francis Badini, and published as the Act directs by Wm. Cock,
42 Pall Mall, Aug. 7, 1797.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>A fanology fan, of different design but with the same directions, invented
by Badini, was published five months earlier (March 18) by Robert
Clarke, Fanmaker, No. 26 Strand, London.</p>

<p>The new conversation or tête-a-tête fan gives as a centre medallion
Venus robbing Cupid of his Bow, with inscribed compartments on both
sides, having reference to the Answer and Question of the Lady to the
Gentleman.</p>

<p>The language of the fan has already been referred to in an earlier
chapter, portions of the code being given. See Spanish fans,
page 137.</p>

<p>Gypsy, fortune-telling and necromantic fans form a large class, and were
common during the latter part of the eighteenth century. As early, however,
as Aug. 3, 1734, a necromantic fan was advertised in the <i>Craftsman</i> as

<p>A necromantic fan was issued by Gamble; ‘Dear Doctor consult the
Stars,’ representing an old necromancer being consulted by ladies.</p>

<p>‘Gypsy’ fans are invariably arranged according to a regular principle.
A medallion in the centre, of a Gypsy telling fortunes, the different cards,
together with their significance, arranged in four rows over the general field
of the fan, and at the top, or on the reverse, the explanation, or directions for
telling fortunes. The ‘Gypsy Fan’ conforms to this rule so far as the
medallion is concerned: in lieu, however, of the cards with their explanation
we have a series of floral festoons, borders, etc., painted by hand. The fan
‘made by Clarke and Co., at their Warehouse, the King’s Arms, near
Charing Cross, Strand, London. Inventors of the much esteemed sliding
Pocket Fan.’<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></p>

<p>The ‘Oracle’ has in the centre a wheel of fortune with two winged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">Pg 256</a></span>children on clouds, one of whom holds a scroll inscribed ‘Oracle.’ On the
sides of the fan the names of the ten greater gods and goddesses, in ten
columns, the names disposed differently in each. On the lower part of the
fan the ‘Explication’ of the Oracle, and ‘examples’ together with the questions,
as—‘Whether one is to get Riches; Whether one will be successful
in Love; What sort of a Husband shall I have’; etc. etc. On the reverse
are heads of the gods and goddesses with their attributes, with ten columns
of inscriptions, each containing ten answers to questions.</p>

<p>Pub. accord. to Act, Jany. 1, 1800, by Ino. Cock, I. P. Crowder &amp; Co.,
No. 21 Wood Street, Cheapside, London.</p>

<p>The ‘Wheel of Fortune, by which may be known most things that
can be required,’ presents us with a variation of the foregoing. The
wheel occupies the centre of the fan, with four female heads representing—1.
Bath Gypsy. 2. Norwood Gypsy. 3. Corsican Gypsy. 4. York Gypsy.
On the one side of the fan, ‘Phisiognomy,’ with directions how to read it;
on the other, ‘Perilous Days,’ with a prognostication of the date and
manner of death of Napoleon, viz., by suffocation or drowning, at the latter
end of 1810 or beginning of 1812. J. Fleetwood, Sc., 48 Fetter Lane.</p>

<p>An interesting class of fans is that illustrating popular and fashionable
resorts, entertainments, etc., as Bartholomew Fair, Bath, Ranelagh,
Vauxhall Gardens, the Crescent at Buxton, etc.</p>

<p>Henry Morley, in his interesting <i>Memoirs of Bartholomew Fair</i>, has
given us an amusing description of the fan sold in that annual saturnalia,
where Henry Fielding once had an interest.</p>

<p>The humours of the piece are mainly technical. Our Bartholomew
artist, having his own views of perspective, has carefully economised the
number of his figures and left out at discretion bodies or legs in the
treatment of which he was embarrassed. Thus the leg of a drinking-stall
serves also for the wooden leg of a bibulous person standing by.
A man with, apparently, but one arm, salutes, in a manner at once distant
and peculiar, an apple-woman, who lifts up her basket <i>by the apples that
are in it</i>. Our artist, finding that the fourth stall of his machine ‘Ups
and Downs’ would complicate his picture, has left it out altogether, and
with a view also to artistic effect, has denied legs to the gentleman who
is tasting his ale with so much relish, while the hot sausages (for these
curious figures of eight <i>are</i> intended for sausages) grow cold upon his
plate.</p>

<p>Pie Corner, with its delicate pig and pork, is depicted, with Sir
Robert Walpole, orders and all, issuing from the shop.</p>

<p>The fan is engraved in mezzotint, the various subjects forming a
very excellent mosaic of pattern: it was re-engraved and published by
J. F. Setchel in 1829, and was accompanied by a description of the
fair, in which the date of 1721 was assigned to the original. This
and other inaccuracies being first pointed out by Henry Morley,
who showed that the Droll of the siege of Bethulia, containing the
ancient history of Judith and Holofernes, with the comical humours
of Rustego and his man Terrible, said to be performing in Lee and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">Pg 258</a></span>

1732.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<p>A version of the well-known print, after Canaletto, of the Rotunda,
garden, and buildings at Ranelagh is given on a fan in the Schreiber
collection, engraved by N. Parr, 1751.</p>

<p>A view of the Crescent at Buxton also appears enclosed in an oval
medallion, with the inscription, ‘Crescent, Buxton.’</p>

<p>The following advertisements relative to these subjects appeared in
the <i>Craftsman</i>:—</p>

<p>In the interesting fan, giving, within a large cartouche, a view of the
Parades, and Old Assembly Rooms at Bath, 1737, Beau Nash appears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">Pg 259</a></span>in the foreground in lilac coat, with a white hat under his arm,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> addressing
a bevy of fashionable ladies; at the sides are floral and diapered
ornaments in the Chinese taste.</p>

<p>The example illustrated, which is coloured with extreme care, was
acquired by the Baroness Burdett-Coutts at the Walker sale in 1882.
This is the mount referred to by Pinchbeck in his advertisement of</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘June 3, 1738.</p>

<p>‘This day is Published on a Fan Mount (Fit for the Second Mourning or in
colours) An accurate and lively Prospect of the celebrated Grove at Bath, whereon
the rural Pleasures and exact Decorum of the company are curiously represented,
with some cursory Observations on the Behaviour of Sundry Persons, particularly
the famous B. N.</p>

<p>‘Likewise the rural Harmony and delightful Pleasures of Vaux-Hall Gardens.
Also the Royal Repository, or Merlin’s Cave; being an exact Emblem of that
beautiful Structure erected by the late Queen in the Royal Gardens at Richmond.</p>

<p>‘Sold wholesale or retail at Pinchbeck’s Fan Warehouse, etc., by Mr. Crowbrow,
at the India House on the Walks: and at Mr. Dalassol’s and Mr. Weakstead’s
Shops in the Grove at Bath.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Two fans were published in June 1757 by G. Speren, giving a view
of the interior of the Pump-Room at Bath, and the Orange Grove, with
obelisk, garden, and buildings.</p>

<p>Lady Charlotte Schreiber quotes the following advertisement which
appeared in the <i>Craftsman</i> during this year:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘This day is publish’d, by Jonathan Pinchbeck, Fan-maker, at the Fan and
Crown in New Road-Court in the Strand, and sold by him Wholesale and Retail.</p>

<p>‘The Bath Medley; Being an accurate and curious Draught of the Pump
Room at Bath, and most of the known Company who frequent it, adorn’d with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">Pg 260</a></span>the Portraitures of her Royal Highness the Princess Amelia<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> and other illustrious
personages who honour’d the Place with their Presence the last Season; wherein
the Topicks of Discourse and Conversations of Companies are impartially consider’d;
their different Behaviours, Airs, Attitudes, etc., judiciously represented; the Foppery
of the Beaus hinted at, and the Intrigues of the famous B— N— and others fully
exploded. Taken from the Life, and finely delineated in above fifty Hieroglyphical
figures.</p>

<p>‘<i>N.B.</i>—A spurious pyratical Copy of this Fan is lately publish’d, which is not
like the Place it should represent, and may easily be discover’d from the Original
by its having Pillars to support the Musick Gallery, and in the Middle is wrote
The Bath Medley.’</p></blockquote>

<p>The first Pump-Room was opened in 1706, with all the éclat of a
public procession, and a musical fête, at which was sung a song specially
composed in honour of King Bladud, the father of Lear, and mythical
founder of Bath, recounting the story of his glorious deeds, and his
soaring ambition, which, Icarus-like, finally overreached itself.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">Pg 261</a></span></p>

<p>The sequel to the story is to be found in the following quotation
in Meehan, <i>Famous Houses of Bath</i>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘Vex’d at the brutes alone possessing</div>
<div class="line">What ought to be a common blessing:</div>
<div class="line">He drove them thence in mighty wrath,</div>
<div class="line">And built the stately town of Bath.</div>
<div class="line i2">The Hogs, thus banished by the Prince,</div>
<div class="line i2">Have liv’d in Bristol ever since!’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Pump-Room illustrated on the fan was erected in 1732, and was,
together with the Assembly-rooms, really the creation of Beau Nash, who
persuaded one Thomas Harrison to build a room for dancing on the east
side of the Grove, with access to the bowling-green, which then became
known as Harrison’s Walks. To maintain his supremacy, Nash rented
the Pump-Room from the corporation, and put it under the charge of an
officer called the Pumper, and for a while induced Harrison to accept
three guineas a week for the Assembly-rooms and candles.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></p>

<p>The Grove was re-named the Orange Grove by this same worthy,
who erected the obelisk in the centre in commemoration of the visit of
the Prince of Orange who came to Bath for the benefit of his health.</p>

<p>The exterior of the Rotunda, house, gardens, etc., at Ranelagh, is
given on a fan mount in the Schreiber collection, this being a copy of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">Pg 262</a></span>print entitled ‘Vue de l’Extérieur de la Rotonde. Maison &amp; Jardins,
etc., à Ranelagh. ‘Canaleti, delin.’ ‘N. Parr, sculpt.’ Published according
to Act of Parliament. December 2, 1751.’</p>

<p>Opera fans give plans of the boxes at the Opera, with names of the
occupants. An example in the Schreiber collection is inscribed: ‘New
Opera Fan for 1797. W. Cock. Publish’d as the Act Directs for the
Proprietor, by Permission of the Manager of the Opera House, 42 Pall Mall.’</p>

<p>The following advertisement appeared in the <i>Times</i> of January 1,
1788:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">‘<span class="smcap">The Opera Fans.</span><br />

‘To the subscribers and frequenters of the King’s Theatre.</p>

<p>‘Last Saturday were published according to <i>Act of Parliament</i>. The Delivery,
however, was put off until the re-opening of the Opera House next week, for the
purpose of presenting them in the best state of improvement.</p>

<p>‘These fans are calculated to present at one view both the number of boxes
including the additional ones, names of subscribers, etc., and have been carefully
compared with the plan of the House or kept at the office, and will be sold only by
the proprietor, Mrs. H. M., No. 81 Haymarket, where she will receive with respectful
gratitude any commands from the ladies and wait on them if required.’</p></blockquote>

<p>A fan published on the same date, January 1, 1788, by Clarke and Co.,
appears in the Schreiber collection, and gives the plan of the King’s Theatre
for 1788; the centre box bears the names of the Duke and Duchess of
Cumberland and that of the Duke of York; the Prince of Wales and Mrs.
Fitzherbert being in box sixty-three on the right.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p>Fans illustrative of the ‘tender passion’ naturally form a large class, and
may be divided into the following groups:—</p>

<p class="indent2 padl2">1. Satirical and Amusing.</p>

<p class="indent2 padl2">2. Pastoral, Social, and Fancy.</p>

<p class="indent2 padl2">3. Subjects from Classic Mythology, as ‘The Marriage of Cupid and
Psyche,’ ‘The Theft of Cupid’s Bow,’ ‘The Offering of Love,’ etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">Pg 263</a></span></p>

<p>Maps of the affections were common both in this country and on the
Continent, and are invariably designed on the principle of the Italian fan,
‘Il Paese del Matrimonio,’ referred to page 269.</p>

<p>The following advertisement appeared in the <i>Craftsman</i> for January
13, 1732-3:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Daniel Chandler, Fan maker in the Strand over against Southampton St., who
invented and sold the Lilliputian Fans,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> and Variety of other pleasant Fans, is now
provided with a Parcel of fashionable Fans, neatly mounted, representing the map of
Tender, which may afford Entertainment both for Ladies and Gentlemen who are
Tenderly inclined, and disposed to be agreeably merry.</p>

<p>‘These fans and Mounts are likewise sold by Michael Burnet, Fan maker, at
the Hand and Fan, over against Friday St. in Cheapside.’</p></blockquote>

<p>On the same date, Saturday, January 13, 1732-3, Pinchbeck announces
the ‘Courting Fan Mounts.’</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘An Embleme of the Four different Stages of life finely delineated in seven
hieroglyphical Figures. Being a lively representation of the Address of young Lovers,
the Raptures of a new-married couple; the reciprocal Harmony of Antient wedded
companions; and the abject, wretched state of an Old Maid. Illustrated with a
Paraphrase, on each cut, which serves as a Key to the whole.</p>

<p>‘<i>N.B.</i>—At the abovesaid Place may be had all sorts of Fans and Fan-mounts of
the newest Fashion, and at the lowest prices, wholesale or retail.’</p></blockquote>

<p>On April 20, 1734, Pinchbeck advertises:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘The Old Man’s Folly.—In this Fan is represented an old Miser, who at the age
of Fourscore had the Vanity to court a young lady of Twenty; she despises his
Addresses, and Cupid shoots Thunder at his Head: in this Dilemma, Bacchus invites
him to a Banquet at the Nectarius Grove; whilst the Eye of Heaven shines propitious
on the Raptures of a youthful couple.</p>

<p class="center">‘Where may be had</p>

<p>‘The abject, wretched state of an Old Maid, and divers other curious Fans; the
Designs taken from the best Masters.’</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">Pg 264</a></span></p>
<p>These two fans had been announced earlier by Pinchbeck on Jan. 15th
of the same year, as follows:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Just Published.... The Amours of an Old Batchellor, or the Downfall of Sir
Limberham; likewise the four different Stages of Life; or the abject, wretched State
of an Old Maid. To each of these Fans are prefix’d, Verses suitable to the Occasion,
which explain the Design.’</p></blockquote>

<p>M. Gamble, on August 11, 1739, advertises</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘A new Fan, wherein is delineated a Damsel bewailing the Loss of her Lover, who
is represented as cast away in a Storm.</p>

<p>‘Where may also be had, a Fan lately publish’d entitled The Sailor’s Wedding,
being made to the glorious and immortal Majesty of Queen Elizabeth.’</p></blockquote>

<p>‘Before and after Marriage’ gives expression to an idea which also
supplied a favourite <i>motif</i> for English and especially Staffordshire pottery.
On a cream ware jug, with illustrations of courtship and matrimony, we
have the following couplets expressive of the two contrasting conditions:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘In courtship Strephon careful hands his lass</div>
<div class="line">Over a stile a child with ease might pass.’</div>
<div class="line"><b><span class="gesperrt2">.....</span></b></div>
<div class="line i04">‘But wedded, Strephon now neglects his dame,</div>
<div class="line">Tumble or not, to him ‘tis all the same.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The fan leaf, published in Paris, but also issued in England, illustrates
two scenes, in the former of which Cupid smiles approvingly: in the latter,
Cupid in the background is overwhelmed with grief at this instance of
Strephon’s indifference; above are inscriptions in French and Spanish:
‘La Complaisance de l’Amant ou Huit jours avant,’ and ‘L’indifférence du
Mari ou Huit jours après.’ The fan etched from drawings by William
Williams, a name which suggests an English origin of the idea.</p>

<p>A similar contrast is drawn in two fans published by J. Read, Feb. 20,
and Nov. 1, 1795, 133 Pall Mall: ‘The Good Swain’ gives three oval medallions
of ‘The Morning of Youth,’ ‘Mid-Day of Life,’ and ‘Chearful Evening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">Pg 265</a></span>of Old Age,’ each subject being provided with four lines of verse commencing
with, ‘Unless with my Amanda blest.’</p>

<p>The ‘Good-for-nothing Swain’ gives ‘The Vow of Constancy,’ ‘The
Hour of Infidelity,’ and ‘Cupid’s Farewell,’ the verses commencing, ‘With
soothing Smiles he won my easy heart.’</p>

<p>Both fans bear the name of ‘G. Wilson,’ who appears on a number
of fans of this period both as designer, engraver, and publisher, and
evidently supplied designs, or stock, to other publishers.</p>

<p>Among the more successful humorous fans are those giving,
in a series of medallions along the border of the fan, ‘A selection
of Beau’s, Whimsical, Comical, and Eccentrical; or Candidates for the
Ladies’ Favour’; and ‘The Ladies’ Bill of Fare, or a Copious Collection
of Beaux.’ The various kinds of lovers are each provided with a suitable
inscription above and below, as: ‘A Spark of some Conceit, Let
me die if I don’t believe she thinks of me Night and Day,’ ‘A Man
of high price, I am determined not to Marry any Woman under a
Dutchess,’ etc. ‘The Merry Lover,’ and ‘I Live, Love, and Laugh,’ etc.
In the centre of the fans, underneath a flying Cupid, are verses in
further elucidation of the subject:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘That simple thing—A woman’s Heart,</div>
<div class="line i1">How oft ‘tis play’d upon;</div>
<div class="line">What Beau’s oft cause its painful smart,</div>
<div class="line i1">And triumph when they’ve done.’</div>
<div class="line padt05">‘Mark well our Motley Group above,</div>
<div class="line">The little shun—the Honest love.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and on ‘The Ladies’ Bill of Fare’:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘To plague and please all womankind,</div>
<div class="line i1">Here’s Gallants sure a plenty!—</div>
<div class="line">Chuse then a Beau to suit your mind,</div>
<div class="line i1">Or change ‘till one content ye.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">Pg 266</a></span></p>

<p>These fans are engraved in mixed line and stipple, the name ‘G.
Wilson, del<sup>t</sup>.,’ appearing on the first mentioned, with ‘London, published
May 25, 1795, by I. Read, No. 133 Pall Mall.’ On the latter, ‘Published
as the Act directs by G. Wilson, 14 Feb. 1795, 108 St. Martin’s
Lane.’</p>

<p>Other fans having reference to the affections, and issued by the same
publisher, are: ‘The Progress of Love’ in the five stages of ‘Cupid
Relieved’; ‘Amantha Rewarded’; ‘Pastime of Love’; ‘Altar of Hymen’;
‘Connubial Bliss’; ‘The Lady’s Adviser, Physician, and Moralist, or,
Half-an-Hour’s Entertainment at the Expense of Nobody!’ and ‘The Quiz
Club’—the latter giving twelve circular medallions of ridiculous characters
round the border of the fan, with suitable descriptions underneath:</p>

<p>Trips to Gretna were among the earliest results of the abolition of
Fleet marriages by Lord Hardwicke’s New Marriage Act of 1753, one
of the most famous of these clandestine marriages being that of Richard
Lovell Edgeworth ten years later. The fan illustrates, in six scenes, the
progress of a love match from the first meeting, to a marriage at Gretna,
and final forgiveness by the bride’s father—‘The First Impression,’ ‘Mutual
Declaration,’ ‘The Refusal,’ ‘The Flight,’ ‘The Journey’s End,’ ‘The
Reconciliation.’</p>

<p>This subject also formed a favourite <i>motif</i> for the Staffordshire potter
of the period, who produced a number of groups characterised by that
quaint humour which appears to be native to him. It will be observed
that in the fan, as in the pottery figure groups, the popular idea of the
‘blacksmith’ is perpetuated. This popular notion, however, is thus
disposed of by Jeaffreson, the historian of matrimony (<i>Brides and Bridals</i>):
‘There is no evidence that any one of the Gretna Green marriages was
solemnised in a smithy, or that any one of the famous Gretna Green
‘couplers’ ever followed the smith’s calling. One of these so-called parsons
had been a common soldier, another a tobacconist, a third a pedlar, and
all of them drunkards and cheats, but no one of them ever shod a horse
or wrought an iron bolt.’</p>

<p>The state of widowhood also supplies the <i>motif</i> of a number of fans,
the subject usually taking the form of a woman in classical costume,
mourning over an altar, urn, or tomb; the central figure-subject generally
engraved in stipple, the landscape completed by hand. Several examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">Pg 268</a></span>
are in the Schreiber collection, the most successful being that signed
‘F. Burney, del.; H. Meyer, sculpt.’</p>

<p>In the third group, subjects from classic mythology, the prevailing
method or decorative scheme is that of an engraved medallion, large or
small, occupying the centre of the fan, to be enclosed in, or incorporated
with, an ornamental setting painted by hand; the character and treatment
of the subject representing that pretty, sentimental quasi-classicism which
set in about the middle of the century, and which we associate with the
names of Cipriani, Angelica Kauffmann, and the engraver Bartolozzi. A
characteristic example is the design by G. B. Cipriani, R.A., of Orpheus
and Eurydice emerging from Hades, their way being lighted by the torch
of Cupid. The medallion is engraved in stipple, the field of the fan being
completed by ornaments in black, grey, pale blue, and silver.</p>

<p>A variation of this decorative scheme has three medallions with
arabesque ornamentation also engraved, the fan usually being sold uncoloured
but occasionally tinted; an example being ‘The Power of Love’—a
Cupid riding on the back of a lion, engraved by Bartolozzi from the
antique gem by Protarchos at Florence, with two smaller medallions of
Cupids. ‘Publish’d as the Act directs, March 1, 1780, by A. Poggi.’<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<p>An interesting fan in the Wyatt collection is printed on chicken
skin, with an almanac in Spanish, decorated with the signs of the Zodiac
in circles, and borders of fruit, flowers, etc., coloured and gilt. The stick
and guards of pierced and carved ivory, painted.</p>

<p>A class of fan popular both in France and England, during the
middle and latter half of the eighteenth century, has a medallion subject
or series of subjects superimposed upon a streamer of lace; this last</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">Pg 269</a></span></p>
<p>being carefully engraved and coloured, the subjects painted, often with
great elaboration. An excellent French example occurs in the Wyatt
collection, with a cartouche enclosing a battle-piece, flowers, and insects
introduced amongst the lace; the stick mother-of-pearl, gilt and silvered,
with ‘gold-fish’ inlay; the whole colour effect extremely fine.</p>

<p>Printed fans were by no means confined to France and England,
although it is in these countries that the practice obtained most extensively;
fans were issued in Germany giving portraits of the Emperor
Leopold <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> and his wife, Maria Louisa of Spain, and their family; of
Frederick <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, who is represented as in Elysium, having just embarked
from Charon’s boat; of Frederick William <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> and Queen Louise of Prussia,
and of Madame Royale, in allusion to her release in 1795 and her subsequent
arrival in Vienna. The famous engraver Chodowiecki also
produced several fans, prints of which occur in the Berlin Museum.</p>

<p>Two Italian examples may be referred to. The subject known as
grotesque animals was obviously executed as a central subject, the field of
the fan to be completed by hand. It is an extraordinarily skilful
engraving of a number of animals playing different antics. In the centre
is a monkey in cocked-hat and feather, extracting with a pair of forceps
a tooth from a fowl who is laying an egg the meanwhile. Sympathetic
birds are perched around, and a squirrel is in attendance with a glass of
refreshment on a tray. The design is made up of similar grotesque
incidents—as a dog with a pair of tongs over his shoulder, returning
from a rat-catching expedition; a porcupine reading a book with the aid
of a magnifying glass; a fox with two young foxes riding on the back
of a fish which is duly provided with a huge pair of spectacles, etc. etc.
The humours of the piece are too many to be described in detail. No
publisher’s or artist’s name appear. The extreme length is nine inches.</p>

<p>In the subject ‘Il Paese del Matrimonio,’ the centre of the fan is
occupied by a Cupid standing in a boat, saying: ‘Andiamo, chi viene al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">Pg 270</a></span>
paese del matrimonio,’ and ‘Venite, signorine, Ciascana delle vostre madri
falto prima di voi questo viaggio. La mia barca è della più leggiere,
se non vi condurre a buon porto non mi pagherete.’ On either side are
maps of two imaginary countries—Terra del celibato and Paesi del
matrimonio, with pictorial representations of the various places. The
former apparently is the country of tranquillity; on it are figured the
Tempio della pace, the Fontana della quiete, the Città dell’ independenza,
the Paradiso terrestre.</p>

<p>The country of matrimony is approached by the Golfo del Rimprovero
which lies between the Capo della dissimulazione and the Rupe della
gelosia. In this country are discovered the Città d’isagiosa; the Tempio
della discordia, shown as falling to pieces with a volcano hard by; the
montagna dell’ infedeltà, from which springs a stream emptying itself into
the Lago dell’ indifferenza. On the farther side of this country of unrest
lies the Golfo della luna di miele.</p>

<p>Of the processes of engraved fans, the most usual is that of
etching, often finished (sweetened is the technical term) by means of the
graver or burin. Pure line-engraving is frequently employed, although
most line-engravers make use of the etched line as a foundation for subsequent
work with the burin. Etching is occasionally supplemented by
stipple-engraving and the free use of the roulette. Many fans are painted
in a brownish black ink with the flesh-tints in red; in others several
colours are introduced, thus anticipating the modern process of coloured
etching. This latter is practically a system of painting upon the plate in
colours, and can scarcely be considered as a legitimate process, although
the result in modern coloured etching is often interesting, and in some
instances even admirable. Aquatint was also employed, especially during
the earlier years of the nineteenth century, on a number of fan leaves
illustrating the Peninsular War. Many of these were produced in
London by Behrmann and Collman, for the Spanish market, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">Pg 271</a></span>
inscriptions in Spanish. Portraits of the Duke of Wellington were also
popular.</p>

<p>After the introduction of lithography many fans were produced by
means of this process, invented by Aloys Senefelder of Munich about 1798;
all lithographed fans must therefore be of a subsequent date to this.</p>

<p>This process was employed as a groundwork for subsequent painting,
often carried to a high pitch of finish, so much so, that it is difficult for
any but a practical eye to detect the lithographic foundation. Examples
of these fans, which include a great variety of subjects, appear in most
collections.</p>

<p>Lithography has been employed during the whole of the nineteenth
century for the decoration of fans, and is largely in use at the present
time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>MODERN AND PRESENT-DAY FANS</h3>

<p><span class="figleft125" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/i_518.jpg" width="125" height="262" alt="" />
</span>WE now gather together the various threads of
our subject at the point where they were left,
viz. the close of the Empire. We have
found that during two centuries and a half—from
1600 to 1800, with a little overlapping at
either end—the fan passed through the various
stages of development and decline; that during
the latter years of the sixteenth century both
Italy and France, but especially the former,
produced objects which may be legitimately
described as fine art; that in France, if we
make allowance for, and accept a different
standard of taste and fashion, the most exquisitely
dainty things were produced, the
period of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span> being that of the highest development of the art,
with a steady decline from thence onwards.</p>

<p>During the first three decades of the nineteenth century the fan
languished. The storm and upheaval of the Revolution, the general
unrest caused by the Napoleonic wars, were among the chief contributing
causes, together with the fact that the great families had fled from
France, taking their fans with them. For the first fifteen years of the
century, there is little to record except a difference of proportion. ‘Towards
1800,’ to quote M. Rondot, ‘the brins were only 6 or 7 centimetres to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">Pg 273</a></span>gorge; towards 1813 this was increased to 8 centimetres, and to 19
centimetres in 1841.’</p>

<p>‘When the brisés returned into favour in 1804,’ continues this author,
‘the fan-makers employed leather, silver, copper, asses’ skin, and cardboard.
The blades were short, and were made by the cutters who ornamented
them; this was also the case with the fans of horn which were fashionable
towards 1829-30.’</p>

<p>Three examples are given of the earlier years of the century: the first,
from the collection of Miss Moss, formerly belonged to Miss Charlotte
Yonge the authoress, and is worked upon a foundation of net, with cut and
pierced steel decorations. The painted subject in the centre represents a lady
seated in a garden, and a boy with hoop and dog; the stick of pierced ivory
piqué with silver. An Italian example almost identical with this, with
the exception of the painted subject, appears in the Museo Civico, Venice.</p>

<p>The fan of asses’ skin, from the same collection, is cut to a perforated
pattern, painted in the centre with a subject of birds and flowers, the outside
blades of ivory, the whole piqué with silver. These <i>peau d’âne</i> fans were
used by <i>élégantes</i> at balls, as tablets upon which the names of partners for
the dance were inscribed by means of a leaden or silver pencil. The colour
is a light slaty-grey; their size averaged from 9 to 10 inches.</p>

<p>The fan which, by the courtesy of Mr. Leopold de Rothschild, we are
enabled to illustrate, is elaborately cut to fine perforations, and painted
with a large medallion in the centre representing a music lesson, a
number of smaller miniatures on the blades, with gilding.</p>

<p>In 1827 the fan was the provocative cause of the conquest of Algeria
by the French. A blow on the head of the French consul from the plumed
fan of Hussein Dey resulted in an apology being demanded and refused,
with the consequent declaration of war.</p>

<p>‘In the course of the year 1828,’ says M. Uzanne, ‘at the time of
representations of a comic opera entitled <i>Corisandre</i>, as the heat was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">Pg 274</a></span>
suffocating, the youthful dandies fainting languidly in their boxes, it
occurred to a Paris manufacturer to sell green paper fans to the men, and
the whole theatre was therefore furnished with them. Fashion adopted
this innovation of masculine fans, which received the name of <i>Corisandres</i>,
but this originality endured but a short time in Paris, as also in Venice
and the principal cities in Italy, where men became familiar with the play
of the fan;—the beaux abdicated the sceptre of the woman, and resumed
as before their Malacca canes.’</p>

<p>An amusing story is told of a near-sighted French writer, who, on
a sultry summer evening at the Opéra, was much incommoded by the
flip-flapping of the fans of two persons who sat immediately behind him.
Turning to the two delinquents,  My dear ladies,’ said he, in the politest
of tones, ‘if you will kindly moderate the use of your fans you will render
me the happiest of men.’ Instead, however, of the dulcet tones of a
lady’s voice, a deep bass smote his ear, and he found himself confronted
with the black-bearded, furious, and reddened visages of two lieutenants
of the Guards. The <i>amende</i> quickly followed.</p>

<p>It was the circumstance of a grand ball given at the Tuileries in 1829
that occasioned the renaissance of the fan. Madame la Duchesse de
Berri was organising a Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span> costume quadrille—fans of the period
were required to complete the <i>tout ensemble</i>, and none were available. At
length one of the guests recollected an old <i>parfumeur</i> in the Rue Caumartin,
named Vanier, who had collected ancient fans: these were conveyed to the
palace, where, in the quadrille, they created extraordinary interest—were
eagerly purchased, and from this time onward in the most exclusive circles,
in spite of the fickleness of that jade, Fashion, the fan has retained its
hold upon the affections of the fair.</p>

<p>The earliest result of this revival of taste for old fans was, perhaps
naturally, a general imitation of old models, and lifeless reproductions of
the fans of the Louis Quinze period were made.</p>

<p>It will readily be perceived that this way did not lead to artistic
salvation—that it served no good purpose to open up the graves of a
dead century and to disturb its poor ghosts. It is true that things were
changing for the worse, but there is a healthiness in the very act and spirit
of change, even though that change should represent a temporary decline.</p>

<p>This is the epoch of which it will be said that men actually, by
some mysterious means, were deprived of what may for present purposes
be called their sixth sense, when, though their eyelids were unclosed, they
saw not, or only in a perverted manner; it is, nevertheless, one of the
curiosities of this most singular epoch that while the general level of
artistic attainment was so low, its pictured shadows so dark, the prevailing
gloom should be illuminated here and there by lights more bright and
intense than in the two preceding epochs. In other words, while we fail
to trace with any measure of certainty any single instance, during the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, of an artist of the first calibre
touching the fan, during the first half of the century that succeeded,
the fan may boast of such names as Horace Vernet, Ingres, Isabey, and
others only a little less distinguished. These represent the welcome oasis
in the dreary desert of mediocrity—the limpid springs at which from
time to time we may pause for a few moments to refresh ourselves. Of
the work of these famous painters, an ‘Arab dance’ by Horace Vernet
is recorded; as also ‘Diana and Endymion,’ the subject treated in the
Etruscan style by Ingres, who constantly in his pictures introduced fans,
as witness the portrait of Madame Devauçay, referred to in an earlier
chapter, ‘The Odalisque,’ and ‘The Harem.’ We have also, later, an
‘Allegory of the Arts’ by Robert Fleury, a ‘Fête’ by Gérome, and fans
by Diaz, Vibert, Lami, Glaize, and Jacquemart.</p>

<p>‘The revolution of 1848,’ says M. Rondot, in his report on the 1851
Exhibition, ‘would have crushed the French fan industry if it had not been
for the orders for exportation. The production, which in Paris amounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">Pg 276</a></span>
to the value of three million francs in 1847, was reduced by half in the
disastrous year that followed; of 565 workers of both sexes 315 were
thrown out of employment. At the time of writing’ (1854), continues this
author, ‘the industry was in a very flourishing condition.’ This prosperity
has been maintained to the present day, ‘Paris being still the only city
where a fan may command the price of a hundred pounds.’<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<p>The number of artists and workers employed in Paris and the Oise,
says M. Duvelleroy in his report on the Paris Exhibition of 1867, is
4000; the annual value of the production being ten million francs, of
which three-fourths is for the foreign market. ‘Paris et la Chine ont
seuls le monopole du commerce des éventails, mais c’est aujourd’hui, en
Europe, une industrie toute française, pour laquelle le monde entier est
notre tributaire.’<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> The evidence of this exhibition, further affirms this
author, showed that France incontestably held the first rank.</p>

<p>‘Spain, who for thirty years had tried to organise her industry, has
only arrived at the production of the commoner classes of fans. Italy,
who uses fans greatly, does not make them; Portugal being only the
third in the European market.’ The British record is correspondingly
poor. ‘In the Great Exhibition of 1851,’ says Lady Bristol, ‘there was
not one single fan of British manufacture exhibited,’<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> and so far as painted
fans are concerned, the statement made by Redgrave in his notes to the
Catalogue of the Fan Exhibition at South Kensington in 1870, ‘that there
were no English fanmakers living except those who made cheap and
coarse fans, is substantially correct to-day.’<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<p>The evidence of the fans themselves bears out these statements. The
instance may be cited of an engraved fan in the Schreiber collection
(No. 69, Mounted Fans) recording Mr. Albert Smith’s ascent of Mont
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">Pg 277</a></span>Blanc in 1851, bearing the imprint of the French firm, ‘Leroux et Cie.,
Fan’s Manufactr., 41 rue Notre Dame de Nazereth, Paris.’ This obviously
produced exclusively for the British market.</p>

<p>From Germany comes similar evidence of French pre-eminence; the
wedding fan of the Grand Duchess of Baden, exhibited at Karlsruhe in
1891, is signed by a French artist, ‘A. Soldé, 1855,’ who produced a
number of fans, and is made by a well-known French maker, Frédéric
Meyer of Paris. This is painted with the subject of a sacrifice at the
Altar of Hymen, and portrait busts of the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess,
the initials F. and L., together with ‘Coblentz, 30 Sept. 1855,’ and is a
typical fan of the mid-nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Of the work of Soldé, a most excellent example, Le Bal d’Amours, is
given, graciously lent by H.R.H. Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll.
The leaf is signed on both obverse and reverse, ‘A. Soldé,’ and inscribed,
‘Grand Bal donné sous le patronage de Madame.’ The mother-of-pearl
stick finely pierced and carved. This formed part of the famous collection
of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>In 1859 an event occurred of the most fateful interest for the fan,
M. Alphonse Baude of Sainte-Geneviève (Oise) having invented his
system of cutting and carving the sticks <i>à jour</i> by machinery! Let us
understand clearly what this means to us. Nature, ever bounteous,
provides us gratis, without any patent dues, with an instrument—the
human hand—the most exquisitely delicate and complicated machine
known to us; this instrument is directed by a force—the human mind—still
more subtle, if possible, in the delicacy of its operations. In place of
this, M. Alphonse Baude, in his wisdom, offers us his conglomeration
of wheels, axles, metal bolts, and screws! The intelligent fan-lover
will therefore note this date, and carefully examine any fan sticks made
subsequent to it.</p>

<p>Fans, however, have been made from time to time having reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">Pg 278</a></span>
claims to the possession of artistic qualities. M. Rondot mentions a fan
carved in mother-of-pearl and signed by Camille Roqueplan for Duvelleroy,
that sold for 1000 francs. A Danish sculptor, M. S. G. Schwartz of
Copenhagen, exhibited at Paris in 1867 an ivory fan carved with reliefs of
the Seasons after Thorwaldsen; a most beautiful work.</p>

<p>Another brisé fan, finely pierced and carved, presented by the ladies
of Copenhagen to H.R.H. the Princess of Wales (Queen Alexandra) on
the occasion of her marriage in 1863, gives five circular medallions, the
centre having the initials A. A. surmounted by the crown, the other four
of classical subjects. Underneath, a processional group of Apollo in his
chariot, the Graces and the Muses; above, a border of Cupids holding
wreaths of flowers; the guards richly embossed in gold, with foliage,
flowers, etc., in high relief. The above instances, as well as others that
might be named, are exceptional; there can be no possibility of doubt
that while the leaves of fans, upon occasion, due to the fact of artists of
high calibre having essayed the fan, present some advance, the work of
the stick, during the whole of the nineteenth century, exhibits a serious
falling off from that of the preceding epochs. This unsatisfactory state
of things can only be remedied by a general advance in public taste, by
the creation of a demand for the higher class fans, and by individual
artists of approved skill turning their attention to this class of work.</p>

<p>During the latter half of the nineteenth century, three prominent éventaillistes
of Paris, MM. Duvelleroy, Alexandre, and Aloys van de Voorde,
have made most strenuous efforts to revive interest in the higher class of
fans, and have exhibited work by such distinguished painters as
Gavarni, Colin, Hamon, Philippe, Rousseau, Karl Müller, Diaz, Eugène
Lami, Glaize, Compte-Calix, Couture, Corot, Wattier, Soldé, Garnier, M<sup>me</sup>
de Girardin: and such well-known sculptors as Jean Feuchère, Klagmann,
Jacquemart, Riester, the brothers Fannière, Eugène Berger, Bastard, Lanoy,
Vaillant, and others.</p>

<p>Of the work of Gavarni we have unfortunately no example illustrated;
a fan by him appeared at South Kensington in 1870, exhibited by the
Comtesse de Nadaillac. Of other fans enlivened by his light and
humorous touch, two, says Blondel, have become famous: the first was
commissioned by Duvelleroy for Queen Victoria: the second, estimated of
perhaps greater value, formed part of the Empress Eugénie’s rich collection.
Mirecourt, in his biography of Gavarni, tells the following anecdote. Upon
an occasion of the contents of his fine portfolios being praised, he cried,
‘<i>Allons donc!</i> in drawing I have never done but one thing passable; it is a
fan for the Empress.’</p>

<p>Gavarni visited this country in 1847, but does not appear to have
recommended himself personally to his hosts. He may be counted
fortunate in the fact of his having, in spite of a certain spirit of contradiction
in his character, impressed the value of his work upon his fellows
during his lifetime. Great men, like angels, but too often come upon us
unawares, and it is only upon their leave-taking, or after, that we become
sensible of the loss of a gracious presence.</p>

<p>The delicate and refined art of Jean Louis Hamon was especially
suited to the fan. For a considerable period he was associated with the
Royal Porcelain works at Sèvres, producing a number of designs of that
light fanciful character with which we are familiar in his paintings. He
continued this style of composition, says M. Walther Fol, but applied it
to the decoration of fans, in which he excelled. ‘In every sovereign court
they were a coveted possession, and if he had desired to supply all demands
he could have produced nothing besides.’ The subjects of these delicate
fancies in almost every instance have reference to love or marriage. There
were Loves who shot arrows transfixing two hearts at once; there was Love
with outspread wings, seated upon the raised end of a see-saw, while
Hymen, crowned with flowers, held him on high by his weight.</p>

<p>A dress fan made by Alexandre, and painted by Hamon with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">Pg 280</a></span>
subject of ‘An Entomologist,’ and groups of flowers on either side by a well-known
flower painter, was presented to the Countess Granville by the
foreign commissioners of the Universal Exhibition, Paris, October 26, 1867.
The stick is of ivory, carved by C. Rambert with dancing Cupids and foliage,
enriched with ormolu and jewelled turquoise. The gift was accompanied
by a graceful letter from Mr. (afterwards Sir Henry) Cole, the British
Commissioner, referring to the fan as a work of fine art by ‘two distinguished
French painters and one sculptor.’ It is, however, more valuable
as a souvenir of an interesting occasion, and for the beautiful carving of
the stick, than as a representative example of Hamon’s work.</p>

<p>In 1862, J. L. Hamon journeyed to Rome, where he painted ‘L’Aurore,’
exhibited in Paris in the following year, and purchased by the Empress
Eugénie. He died in 1874 at the early age of fifty-three.</p>

<p>Wattier signed a number of fans, of which an exceedingly rich example,
an elaborate composition of nymphs and Cupids, is in the possession of
the Countess Granville. He was born at Lille in 1800, and died in
1868.</p>

<p>The fan leaf, ‘Le Cerf de St. Hubert,’ by Rosa Bonheur (born 1822,
died 1897), is dated 1896, and is consequently one of the latest works of
this illustrious painter, whose fame has become universal. The legend of
St. Hubert and his Christ vision, an unusual subject with modern artists,
though greatly favoured by the painters of the Renaissance, engaged the
attention of Rosa Bonheur as early as 1868, when she produced a crayon
study, similar in treatment to this fan leaf, with the stag shown a little
more in perspective, illustrated in <i>Rosa Bonheur, sa Vie, son Œuvre</i>, Anna
Klumpke, 1908. The stag of the fan leaf, reversed however, presents
many similarities to the famous picture ‘Le Roi de la Forêt,’ painted in
1878, the same studies probably being utilised for both works. The leaf is
of silk, the painting in transparent pigment, with very little body colour
introduced. It appeared at the Franco-British Exhibition in 1908, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">Pg 281</a></span>is in the possession of M. Georges Caïn, Musée Carnavalet, Paris, by
whose courtesy we are enabled to give the illustration. Another fan,
‘Trois Vachers,’ is referred to in the above-mentioned biography.</p>

<p>Claudius Popelin is an artist of the Napoleon <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> epoch, who, in
addition to his work in enamel, produced a number of fans, examples of
which appear in the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris. These are mostly
flowers and objects of natural history, drawn with considerable skill. He
was much befriended by the late Princess Mathilde (cousin of Napoleon <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>)
who presented a fan of her own work to the Empress Eugénie. In the
same collection appear two fans by Ch. Chaplin, whose graceful work in
painting is well known here as on the Continent.</p>

<p>In the art library, Victoria and Albert Museum, is a small collection
of designs for fans, acquired from the Paris Exhibition of 1867, and typical
of the work done during the middle of the century; the fans from these
designs being made, in each instance, by Alexandre. Amongst these
is a silk leaf representing the four ages of Infancy, Youth, Manhood,
and Old Age, forming one group in a large cartouche, occupying three-fourths
of the entire space, extremely ably painted, somewhat recalling
the style of the French painter Flandrin; the colour scheme being a monotone
of mauve with gold embellishments, the panel on a green ground
with lightly designed ornaments, signed F. Fossey, <span class="smcap lowercase">MDCCCLXIII.</span> A
group of Watteau figures dancing, cleverly touched on a light buff
silk mount, and a shepherd piping, with shepherdess and Cupid, a circle of
Cupids hovering round a tree, also in the Watteau style, are examples of
the lighter and daintier style of mount affected by the French artists of this
epoch; the last named signed by Madame Callamatta.</p>

<p>Madame Bisschop, who also has a dainty touch, executed a number of
fans during the sixties and seventies, including the silver-wedding fan of
Mr. and Lady Charlotte Schreiber. This skin mount, now in the Schreiber
collection, British Museum, though it can scarcely lay claim to the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">Pg 282</a></span>
qualities, is, nevertheless, charming in idea and pretty in colour; it represents
a sylvan scene on the borders of a lake upon which are two white swans, a
delicate allusion to the bride and bridegroom. In the centre, underneath
a tree, is a Cupid turning over the pages of a large book, inscribed
‘April 10, 1880, <span class="smcap lowercase">XXV</span>.’ The subject is enclosed within a cartouche of gold
and flowers.</p>

<p>Once again, the Royal Fan, in its hour of need, finds a friend in royalty,
on this occasion the most powerful monarch in Europe, Queen Victoria.
In 1870, the period of perhaps the lowest ebb of the fan’s fortunes in this
country, at the initiative of this royal lady, an exhibition was organised
at the South Kensington Museum (now Victoria and Albert), when
a prize of £400 was offered by Her Majesty, and four hundred and
thirteen examples from the finest collections both here and abroad were
shown.</p>

<p>The great success of this exhibition, and the absorbing interest
displayed in it, naturally led to the organisation of others. Among the
measures adopted by the Worshipful Company of Fanmakers for the
purpose of reviving what was at one time ‘a flourishing industry in
this ancient city,’ a competitive exhibition of fans was held at Drapers’
Hall in 1878, again under the protecting ægis of royalty (H.R.H. Princess
Louise, now Duchess of Argyll). Twelve hundred and eighty-four fans,
ancient and modern, were exhibited; gold, silver, and bronze medals, and
money prizes amounting in the aggregate to £172 were awarded, the
freedom of the Company being in most instances granted to the prizewinners.</p>

<p>Eleven years later (1889) this experiment was repeated. In addition to
prizes offered by the Fanmakers’ Company, others were offered by private
individuals and public newspapers, and one hundred and six works were
entered for competition.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<p>The <i>Queen</i> newspaper, the donor of one of the prizes, commenting
on the exhibition, held at Drapers’ Hall during the month of May,
said: ‘Considered as a whole, the exhibition did not come up to our
expectations. The liberal prizes offered ought to have brought forward
finer and more original work in a branch of minor art which is to be
considered as the special province of lady artists,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> and presents so many
opportunities for fanciful composition and refined taste in arranging and
grouping,’ etc.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1890, the Fanmakers’ Company decided to hold
their third competitive exhibition.</p>

<p>The <i>Daily Graphic</i> of May 17 said: ‘The exhibition of fans organised
last year by the Company of Fanmakers gave so valuable an impetus
to English trade in this direction, that the Company very wisely and
patriotically decided to hold another this season.’</p>

<p>On this occasion no less a sum than £275 was placed at the disposal
of the Company, to be distributed as prizes for fans and fan designs, <i>the
exclusive work of British subjects</i>, the number of exhibits reaching the very
respectable total of six hundred.</p>

<p>In 1891 an important exhibition of ancient and modern fans was held
at Karlsruhe, under the patronage of the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess
of Baden, a sumptuous illustrated record of the exhibition being issued, the
text written by Professor Marc Rosenberg. Sixteen prizes and forty-three
diplomas of honour were offered for competition, in which some of the
foremost continental artists took part. Of these the distinguished Austrian
painter Hans Makart claims a leading place, and may be included in the
already long list of artists of the foremost rank who have given their
attention to fan painting. A design in crayons and water-colour by him
appeared at this exhibition, and is now in the Royal Gallery at Berlin; a
charming vision of a procession of children crowding the whole field of the
fan, suggesting the impossibility of having too many. Professor Eugen</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">Pg 284</a></span></p>
<p>Klimsch of Frankfurt, the winner of one of the prizes, was represented by
‘The Dance,’ a composition of figures in the style of Watteau, a number
of Cupids occupying the centre of the fan, which was priced at the high
figure of £500. Professor Hermann Götz, director of the School of Arts
and Crafts at Karlsruhe, showed an excellent classical composition on
paper, of the chariot of an orb or planet. Professor Ferdinand Keller, of
Karlsruhe, exhibited an apotheosis of the Emperor William I., an excellent
fan mount of a pretty Cupid on a cloud, with a medallion portrait of the
Empress and a large eagle. This in the possession of Mr. J. G. Rosenberg,
who also owns an extremely able composition of a dance of bacchantes by
Georg Papperitz.</p>

<p>There was also a powerful painting of the <i>plein air</i> school, of a pier
with fishing-boats, ‘Bewegte See, Schwanenhaut,’ by Professor Gustav
Schönleber; and an excellent naturalistic painting on silk of parrots,
paroquets, etc., by Max Seliger of Berlin.</p>

<p>The above by no means exhausts the good things of this important
exhibition, in which was represented practically every phase of modern
art, and amply demonstrated the fact that the Germans, artists and
public alike, are much more alive to the importance of the fan, both as
affording an opportunity for artistic expression, and as an accessory of
costume, than we are in this country.</p>

<p>Upon occasion, the fan has led to unforeseen and undesired consequences;
a story is told of the eccentric King Ludwig of Bavaria, the
gallant and prodigal admirer of the dancer Lola Montés. At one of the
balls of his Court, a fair princess having inadvertently let her fan fall to the
ground, the monarch hastened to pick it up and to restore it to the hands of
the giddy beauty, when his forehead came in sharp contact with that of
another gentleman, no less desirous than the king of paying homage to
the fair. The shock was so great and so violent that King Ludwig,
stunned for the moment, soon afterwards discovered growing on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">Pg 285</a></span>forehead that enormous wen, so well known, and as celebrated as it
was unlucky.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>Autograph and inscription fans, which have, during the last two or
three decades become popular with the few fortunate ladies who are happy
in the possession of a circle of artistic friends, are but a revival of an
old-world fashion. We have referred, early in this work, to the custom
of poetic inscription which prevailed in China during the Liang dynasty,
and to the love-sick lady Pan, of the Han dynasty, who adopted this
by way of giving expression to her unrequited love. M. Achille Poussielgue,
<i>Voyage en Chine de M. et M<sup>me</sup> Bourboulon</i>, says: ‘There are fans of
two kinds, open and folding. The former are made of a sheet of ivory
or paper, and are used as autograph albums; and it is upon the surface
of these white fans that a Chinaman begs his friend to leave a sentence, a
drawing, or some characters, by way of recalling the absent to his memory.
These album fans, to which great or noted men affix their seals, become
of great value.’ ‘In the romance, <i>Ping-chan-ling yen</i>, a eunuch attached
to the Emperor’s household, Lieou by name, begs Chân-Tai, the noble
daughter of Chân-hien-jin, to honour him by writing on a fan with her
own fair hand. “My sole desire,” he says, “is to possess a fan ornamented
with your verses.”’ Some of these autograph fans from the Negroni
collection were sold in London about 1866, after the Chinese war, and
are said to have reached the extraordinary figure of £900 apiece.</p>

<p>In Japan, also, a charming device for the entertainment of the guests
at artistic social gatherings consisted in each member of the company
making little sketches expressive of some dainty fancy, or historic incident,
on fans. These were passed round, exchanged, and carried away as
souvenirs of a friendly and interesting occasion.</p>

<p>It was a happy inspiration of the late Lady Alma Tadema to revive the
autograph fan in the form of sign manuals of famous artists and musicians.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">Pg 286</a></span></p>
<p>The fan consists of twenty-six blades of plain wood on which appear the
signatures of such famous painters as Bastien-Lepage, Joseph Israels,
Du Maurier, Legros, accompanied in most instances by characteristic
sketches; and of such musical executants as Charles Hallé, with, in
several instances, the addition of a few bars of music. The sketches
are dated 1879.</p>

<p>The fan of Mrs. Arthur Lewis is a development of the same idea.
This has nineteen blades, and the space between the rounded edge and
the connecting ribbon is utilised for sketches by Orchardson, Colin Hunter,
Pettie, Millais, Leslie, Alma Tadema, Du Maurier, Phil Morris, Ansdell,
J. C. Hook, Frank Dicksee, Goodall, Herkomer, Fildes, Marks, Boughton,
and Adrian Stokes. The outer blades are ornamented by arabesques enclosing
the monogram of the owner, a laurel wreath, and painter’s palettes.
The dates recorded are 1880-84.</p>

<p>The popularity on the Continent of this form of autograph fan is
evidenced by the fact that three examples were shown at Karlsruhe in
1891 from the collection of Herr Conrad Dreher of Munich. These included
the work of such well-known German artists as Ernst Zimmermann, Franz
Stuck, Lenbach, Holmberg, Löwith, Diez, Hermann Kaulbach, and others.</p>

<p>At Karlsruhe, also, was shown an autograph fan belonging to the
Baroness Friederichsy, on which were the signatures of all the diplomatists
who attended the Berlin Congress. Countess Onola possesses a similar
fan, with the autographs of the royal family and the more distinguished
personages of the Berlin Court, including Prince Bismarck and Count
Moltke.</p>

<p>Mrs. Joachim-Gibson has a ‘Wagner’ fan, with printed portrait of
the master, views of the Wagner theatre and of Bayreuth, and, on the
reverse, autographs of famous Wagner singers.</p>

<p>Among novelties or curiosities in fans is an example shown at the
Vienna Exhibition in 1873, in which each rib was a knife or a fork,
or a spoon, or a comb, or a pair of scissors, etc. Any single piece could be
removed for use without spoiling the <i>tout ensemble</i>.</p>

<p>In the exhibition of the Fanmakers’ Company at Drapers’ Hall in
1890, a ‘butterfly fan’ appeared. Two large gauze wings, speckled and
veined to imitate a gigantic insect, form the fan, the body represented by
the handle; upon pressing a button or spring, the wings are set in motion,
and, by their fluttering, fan the bearer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kendal, the famous actress, is also credited with a little surprise,
in the shape of a ‘dressing-case fan.’ This is a fan and entire toilet-case
in one, and affords its owner an opportunity of beautifying herself on
occasions when the ordinary means are unattainable. The sticks are of
silver, the leaf of black gauze, with a black velvet mask, resembling those
the Venetians carry at Carnival time, set in the centre. Behind this mask,
which permits the owner to see everything, may be carried on all the
toilet duties for which the fan contains conveniences. Upon turning back
one of the broad outer sticks, a little mirror is revealed, and underneath
the other is a receptacle for hair-pins, scissors, glove-hook, etc. At the
lower end of the fan is a silver box containing a small powder-puff. This
was advertised some ten or fifteen years ago as manufactured by Messrs.
W. Thornhill and Co.</p>

<p>The employment of the ostrich feather for the folding-fan has been
revived during recent years, following an older custom. Many examples
occurring in old engravings and pictures may be cited; amongst them the
portrait group of the family of Jan Miense Molenaer, by Van Loon,
previously referred to, in which a lady holds a folding-fan of white ostrich
feathers. (See illustration, p. 196.)</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, and for a long subsequent period, Venice
continued to be the principal emporium for supplying ostrich feathers
to Europe, and in no country were they more extensively used than in
England. At present England is the mart of the world for feathers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">Pg 288</a></span>
foreign manufacturers, therefore, must perforce come here to make their
selections.</p>

<p>It is this latter circumstance, doubtless, together with the universal
popularity of the feather itself, which has occasioned their revival—some
of the handsomest fans made at present being of that character. The
æsthetic value of these fans, for the most part depends, no doubt, from
considerations of cost, upon the beauty of the ostrich feather itself, the
sticks being generally of plain ivory, tortoise-shell, horn, or bone—thus
justifying the criticism passed upon one of the prize-winners at a
competitive exhibition at Drapers’ Hall, that it was to the <i>ostrich</i> that
the prize ought really to go. Under no circumstances, however, could
these folding-fans hope to vie with the magnificent rigid fans of the
Elizabethan era, the form of these handles, apparently, offering better
opportunities to the designer than do the radiating sticks of the folding-fan.
If we might have feathers set in handles designed in the sumptuous manner
of these early fans, well and good; if we could have the sticks of the
<i>folding-fans</i> more in keeping with the sumptuous nature of the feather,
well also, though not quite so good; but the ever-present question of
cost must always remain a determining factor.</p>

<p>The feathers of other birds have also been, and are at present, employed
for the purposes of the fan; in this connection the charming
Chinese fan at South Kensington of the feathers of the Argus pheasant
may be cited. (Illustrated facing p. 59.)</p>

<p>The system of applied feather-work is referred to on a number of
occasions in this work, several illustrations being given, notably the
Chinese feather screens belonging to Mr. Crewdson, and the Queen Anne
screen of Mr. Messel. The practice was common during the latter half
of the eighteenth century, used both for fans and other purposes, and
it was a favourite pastime with Mrs. Montague, who refers to it in one
of her letters, dated 1785:—‘I am obliged to you for your kind attention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">Pg 289</a></span>to my feather-work. The neck and breast feathers of the stubble goose
are very useful, and I wish your cook would save those of the Michaelmas
goose for us. Things homely and vulgar are sometimes more useful than
the elegant, and the feathers of the goose may be better adapted to some
occasions than the plumes of the Phœnix.’</p>

<p>Thus Cowper, <i>On Mrs. Montagu’s Feather Hangings</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘The Birds put off their ev’ry hue,</div>
<div class="line">To dress a room for Montagu.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Fashion has again, during recent years, adopted this system of
feather decoration for fans.</p>

<p>‘The latest craze of Viennese society,’ says the <i>New York Commercial</i>,
November 23, 1890, ‘is a passion for fans of mountain-cock
feathers. The last question the young Austrian belle asks her admirer
before he goes on a hunt is, “Won’t you try, please, to bag me a fine
fan?” An ideal fan of this kind must contain only feathers from birds
brought down by the most expert shots, and every feather must be the
lone representative of the giver’s skill; consequently, such a fan may
record the admiration and skill of sixty or seventy hunters. It is not
unusual to have cut in the ribs of the fans a brief account of the circumstances
under which the birds were shot. The German Empress is said
to have expressed a wish last summer for such a fan, and ever since that
time the young bloods of the Austrian Court, who have already bagged
fans for their own women, have been shooting right and left for the
Empress’s sake. The handle of the fan, now being completed in Vienna,
will be set with jewels in the Prussian colours.’</p>

<p>A more unique example of the spoils of sport is the fan which, by
the graciousness of H.R.H. the Princess of Wales, we are enabled to
illustrate here. In this, the blades are of red tortoise-shell, twenty in
number. The feather portion is composed of a series of tiny feathers
from the wing of the woodcock. These, 6520 in number, were supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">Pg 290</a></span>
by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales from the wings of 3260 woodcocks, there
being one only of these miniature feathers in each wing of the bird.
Each single feather is fixed with two stitches of thread and worked upon
a linen base, the back being formed of the ordinary feathers from the
breast and wings.</p>

<p>The fan was commenced on the 18th August 1900, and only completed
on the 28th October 1901. The lady who worked it was unable
to apply herself for more than an hour or so at a time, the work being
so excessively fine and tedious.</p>

<p>The manufacture of the fan was entrusted to Mr. Alfred Clark, of
33 New Bond Street,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> the work being carried out under his direction,
and, we believe, on a principle of his own.</p>

<p>M. Édouard Moreau signed a number of fans from 1860 onwards,
characterised by a charming delicacy of execution and elaboration of detail.
A representative example is given, which appeared in the International
Exhibition of 1862, and was purchased for the South Kensington Museum.
This, an ivory brisé, is painted with three medallions of ‘The Tournament,’
‘Before the Tournament,’ and ‘After the Tournament.’ The
fan was made by Alexandre, and bears very favourable comparison with
the best work of the eighteenth century. (Facing p. 87.)</p>

<p>A fan, also manufactured by Alexandre and painted by Moreau, was
exhibited in 1870 by Madame Maurice Richard (au Ministère des Beaux-Arts,
Paris). The vellum mount has for centre a medallion, with the
initials ‘H. R.’ (Hélène Richard) surmounted by two doves. On either
side are medallions with figures emblematic of Sculpture and Music,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">Pg 291</a></span>carved and pierced in the style of the sixteenth century, is also painted
by Moreau, with medallions of seraphs playing musical instruments, and
supporting emblems of the arts they represent; the guards bearing the
initials ‘H. R.’ in gold.</p>

<p>Many fans bearing Moreau’s signature have mounts of lace, the
ivory stick being minutely painted with medallions of figure subjects
near the handle end, usually three subjects enclosed in an ornamental
setting. An excellent example is given from the collection at the Victoria
and Albert Museum. M. Duvelleroy (of Regent Street) also has a fan
arranged on similar lines; another, in the possession of Mr. G. J. Rosenberg,
was exhibited at Karlsruhe in 1891, both the last named being
made by Alexandre.</p>

<p>This leads us to the important subject of lace mounts. The use of
this delicate material for the fan, especially suited by its lightness and
daintiness, has been revived during recent years.</p>

<p>A lace fan having in the centre the word ‘Elena,’ surmounted by a
royal crown, was made at Burano and presented to Queen Elena of Italy
on her marriage in 1896. In Devonshire, also, lace mounts have been
made; in the Paris Exhibition of 1900 appeared a fan with a coat of
arms in the centre, in which Miss Trevelyan adapted an Italian design
to the old Honiton stitches, illustrated by Mrs. Bury Palliser in her
work on Lace.</p>

<p>Fans have been, and are, a feature of the Youghal lace industry,
established by the sisterhood of the Presentation Convent, county Cork,
the oldest of the many that have sprung up under the fostering care of
the Irish nuns, and dating back to the dark times of 1847, when famine
decimated the rural population of the south and west of Ireland. The
designs are in each instance furnished by the sisters, who are qualified
under the Board of Education.</p>

<p>The Irish flat needle-point of Youghal, though doubtless derived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">Pg 292</a></span>
the first instance from foreign sources, may be said to have developed
into a purely native art, capable of well holding its own against any
contemporary foreign work.</p>

<p>Fan leaves have been worked for many highly placed personages;
the example illustrated was presented by the Earl of Crewe to H.R.H.
the Princess Mary on her marriage, and is, perhaps, one of the most
successful in point of design and richness of effect. A wedding gift to
H.R.H. the Princess Maud of Wales has for centre the initial M. surmounted
by a crown.</p>

<p>A beautiful example, of the finest workmanship, was presented to
H.M. Queen Alexandra on the occasion of her first visit to Ireland after
the Coronation, in 1903, and has for centre the Irish harp, with the
appropriate inscription in Celtic half uncials, on a ribbon running over
the whole field of the fan:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">‘I cool, I refresh, and I can keep secrets.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another fan was presented to H.R.H. the Princess Margaret of
Connaught as a wedding gift, and obtained a prize at an exhibition in
Dublin in 1897. The number of medals awarded by the various international
and other exhibitions testify to the universal appreciation of
this delicate industry, which has for some years past, with the full consent
of the nuns, been formed into a co-operative society, thus enabling the
workers to participate fully in the profits accruing to the association.
The thread is a linen one of various degrees of fineness, from the strong
No. 1 to the almost invisible No. 400, and though so delicately wrought,
it wears better than most other laces, and can be cleaned repeatedly
without suffering injury in texture or appearance.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p>We are enabled, by the gracious permission of Her Majesty, to
illustrate the lace fan presented by the Worshipful Company of Fan-makers <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">Pg 293</a></span>to Queen Alexandra for use on Coronation Day, 1902. This
bears two crossed A’s surmounted by the royal crown. On the panaches
the royal monogram again appears surmounted by the crown.</p>

<p>Lace may be said to be the one single industry remaining comparatively
uninfluenced by the modern art movement, which is professedly
a return to the independent study of natural forms. We say
<i>comparatively</i> uninfluenced, since most praiseworthy, and, indeed, successful
attempts have been made both in this country and abroad to profit
by the abundant ornamental suggestion which Nature everywhere offers
us. The beautiful lace fan contributed by M. Duvelleroy suggests almost
infinite possibilities in the treatment of this charming material; it is
designed on a convention essentially modern; it is the art of to-day, of
the present moment, owing practically nothing to the past, and representing
that revolt against tradition, which, for good or for ill, has come to
be one of the most significant features of modern art.</p>

<p>Nor is this the only instance that might be cited. Excellent
designs for lace mounts, based upon natural forms, have from time to
time been made in our schools; in this connection may be mentioned
the work of Miss Lydia Hammett, of the Taunton School of Art, who
has produced charming fan mounts in Brussels and other lace in which
bird and plant life are happily treated, and with a proper and due sense
of the limitations imposed by the material.</p>

<p>Miss L. Oldroyd, also, has worked a number of charming lace
mounts, including one for a fan presented to Queen Victoria by the
Worshipful Company of Fanmakers on the occasion of the diamond
jubilee.</p>

<p>On the Continent, among some of the most admirably reticent work,
a treatment more frankly unusual has been adopted, not without successful
results. In the article on ‘Der Moderne Fächer,’ in the <i>Kunstgewerbe-blatt</i>
for September 1904, Frau M. Erler gives several admirable examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">Pg 294</a></span>
from Vienna and elsewhere, together with illustrations of her own work,
consisting of a happy arrangement of appliqué embroidery and network
or gauze insertion, extremely effective, and losing none of its value from
the fact of its having been obtained by simple means. We have festoons
of flowers embroidered on a light ground of gauze, with ornamental spaces
of network insertion; we have the mountain-ash arranged symmetrically,
the leaves painted red with embroidered outline; the ‘honesty’ treated as
a broad border, the outline embroidered; the rose treated as an all-over
pattern, the groundwork in artfully alternated lace and net.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the news of Charles Conder’s death reaches us.
He was a man of singular gifts, a modern of the moderns, whose work,
though doubtless derived from that of a past age, would have been
impossible at any other epoch than our own. What Conder undoubtedly
possessed, and in a very high degree, was that subtle quality which
for lack of a better word we call <i>style</i>, a quality not easy of definition,
but readily <i>felt</i>. It would be difficult to say what style <i>is</i>, it is far
easier to say what it is <i>not</i>; it is not for example, <i>design</i>; a man may
possess considerable power of design without much perception of style; it
is not a sense of proportion, although this comes nearer the mark; it is not
originality either, since a man may be very original indeed, and only prove
himself ridiculous; it is rather, a happy blending of these several elements,
and some others also.</p>

<p>To this great gift of nature, since this quality in its highest form
cannot be acquired, Conder added practically nothing. It is with a feeling
akin to resentment that we find faculties so exceedingly rare and so
precious, allied to such a lamentable lack of training and art education.
It is indeed possible that, if his life had been prolonged, these shortcomings
would have been supplied, as Burne-Jones taught himself the
human figure after he became famous; but, after all, criticism is perhaps
somewhat ungracious where there is so much that is admirable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">Pg 295</a></span>and the utility of speculations as to the ‘might have beens’ is extremely
questionable.</p>

<td class="tdri vertt">Mr. John Lane.</td>
</tr></table></div>

<p>The number of Conder fans existing in various collections must be
considerable. Mr. Lane has a dozen, or possibly more, of which perhaps
the finest is reproduced here. Silk is the material employed, to which his
method is especially suited. They appear to have been mounted only in
very rare instances, and are generally framed for purposes of decoration.
There is no reason why they should not be used—in fact, there is every
reason why they should, since suitability to a prescribed purpose is one of
the very first canons of good art. Mrs. Lane has a blue fan, mounted,
and in use.</p>

<p>The work of Frank Conder is obviously founded on that of Charles,
with which it presents many features in common. Among the several
fans by this artist illustrated in the winter number of the <i>Studio</i>, that
representing two young girls holding masks, with Cupids, and in the background
a river and bridge, is perhaps the most individual.</p>

<p>The many admirers of Mr. Brangwyn’s work, and they are legion,
will doubtless welcome the two characteristic examples given of fans by
his hand. In both instances, the colour scheme is a play upon blue, somewhat
similar to, and at the same time, necessarily, vastly different from, the
red fan of Mr. Conder. The motto of Danton the Republican—‘de
l’audace, et encore de l’audace, et toujours de l’audace,’ ‘to dare, and again to
dare, and always and evermore to dare,’ would seem to be peculiarly
fitting to the work of Mr. Brangwyn. In the hands of a less gifted artist
this would probably mean disaster; in the instance of the original of the
coloured illustration, a bold gouache on silk, the result is one of almost
overpowering brilliance. The half-tone illustration represents a sketch on
grey paper, and must be considered merely as the first idea of a fan, to be
materially modified in the working out.</p>

<p>Mr. Brangwyn has, among his multifarious activities, found time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">Pg 296</a></span>
produce quite a number of fans and designs for fans, which have found
their way into various hands. In the <i>Studio</i> winter number for 1901-2
appeared a coloured illustration—a rich composition of young girls gathering
roses—also painted on silk. In the article on ‘Der Moderne Fächer,’
in <i>Kunstgewerbe-blatt</i> for September 1904, by Frau Margaret Erler of
Berlin, previously alluded to, appeared the first sketch for this <i>Studio</i> fan,
vigorously drawn in chalk.</p>

<p>It is impossible at the present stage of a career having in the natural
order of things so much before it, and in the face of such superabundant
energy, to form any definite idea of the ultimate outcome of Mr. Brangwyn’s
art; of his present accomplishment, his etched work, which ranks
amongst the most remarkable produced during recent periods, seems likely,
in the opinion of the present writer, to earn for him the most enduring
fame. If we might conceive etched or engraved fans becoming again
popular in the twentieth, as they were in the eighteenth century, it might
be an interesting speculation as to how Mr. Brangwyn would treat an
etched fan. The material of zinc, which he so much affects, and in which
he has discovered such great possibilities, would, doubtless, be unsuitable
for such a delicate object; nevertheless, we can imagine some rapid and
characteristic note on copper, the print further enlivened here and there by
a touch of colour, as a suitable thing to be fluttered in the hand of the fair.
Such work would provide, in these days of lack of patronage, other artists
also with a means of augmenting their too often, it is to be feared, but
slender incomes, since there would be an additional incentive to purchase a
print that might be applied to a definite purpose, or made the occasion of
some graceful offering.</p>

<p>Mr. H. Granville Fell, whose Court of Love, a composition in the
shape of a reversed heart, with Cupid enthroned in the centre, was illustrated
in the <i>Studio</i> winter number above referred to, is another instance of an
English present-day artist who has essayed fan painting or designing.</p>

<p>Miss Jessie King, whose charmingly original style is admirably suited to
the fan, was also represented in the same publication. The beautiful fan
graciously lent for reproduction by H.R.H. Princess Henry of Battenberg,
the wedding gift of Queen Victoria, is entirely of English workmanship,
designed and painted by a lady student of the Training School at South
Kensington.</p>

<p>‘What style of ornament is most suitable for the fan?’ asks Charles
Blanc, who draws attention to the fact of the pleats breaking up or
distorting the design or picture. Our author suggests as a possible way
out of this difficulty ‘that each pleat or fold should have a separate subject,
or, at least, that the subject be so arranged that the pleats have relation to
each other, as, a Watteau harlequin kissing his hand to a columbine, a
Leander quarrelling with Isabelle, these being placed on blades that in
refolding would reunite the lovers and reconcile the disputants. But to
develop a graceful subject on a series of projecting and retreating angles,
all more or less acute, would be a waste of labour. Is it not better to use
in these cases a different or a radiating ornament? Is it not better to
scatter over a fan a charmingly discordant arrangement of pictures and
colours, or even to place isolated subjects between the folds, in order that
elegant women, in manipulating their fans, may have twenty opportunities
of showing in each fancy group the artist’s talent, and at the same time, of
displaying some special charm of their own—a pretty hand, a well-turned
arm, or beautiful eyes?’<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p>Our author has drawn attention, in his light and charming way, to a
difficulty which is practically insuperable; there is nothing new in this
suggestion of decorating each pleat with a separate subject, or of a consecutive
series of subjects. Many instances of its application might
be cited; some are given in this work, notably the Italian fan of mica, in
which subdivision is carried to its utmost limit. But we must not take our</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">Pg 298</a></span></p>
<p>author <i>too</i> seriously, and although his suggested fan, if carried out, would
be a most exquisite experience, especially if drawn with the power of a
Gavarni, or designed with the skill of a Sambourne or a Caran d’Ache,
the opportunity afforded to the painter by the full space of the mount far
outweighs any slight disturbance of the design caused by the pleating;
moreover, is it not a fact that silk, the material most favoured by modern
artists, which, when prepared with rice size and stretched, offers as suitable
a material as could be desired for the free play of the brush, opens out to
practically a flat surface?</p>

<p>George Augustus Sala has referred to the fan painted by Sir Matthew
Digby Wyatt with the subject of the ‘Triumph of Love,’ as marking the
period of the English revival of fan painting, and as a striking exemplification
of the folly of assuming that a great artist derogates from the dignity
of his calling by painting fans. He may stoop, indeed, says this author
felicitously, but it will be to conquer!</p>

<p>Our task is at length completed; we have endeavoured to trace to its
source in the dimmest past the chequered history of this little toy, once the
pride and the glory of kings, and now the plaything of queens. We trust
we have shown that, in the words of Sir George Birdwood, there is perhaps
more in a fan than was dreamt of in Johnson’s matter-of-fact definition:—‘An
instrument used by ladies to move the air and cool themselves.’</p>

<p>What, then, of the future? May we reasonably look forward in this
twentieth century for a renaissance of the fan; for a re-attainment, if not
of its past spiritual significance, at least of something of its artistic
possibilities?</p>

<p>The future is full of hope; we have turned our backs upon the bad old
nineteenth century, with its manifold outrages upon the æsthetic sense;
the foundations, at any rate, of a living art have begun to be laid—were
begun, as a matter of fact, by this same nineteenth century, following that
strange natural order of the outcome of good from evil and the apparent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">Pg 299</a></span>inseparability of both; a new Phœnix has arisen out of the ashes of

herself invented the folded fan, as she may be said to suggest every invention. The palmetto leaf in its

invention of the folding-fan, although dates are somewhat confusing. At the temple of Mieido in Kyoto,
whither she had retired to hide her grief under the garb of a nun, she cured the abbot of a fever by fanning
him with a paper folding-fan over which she muttered incantations: and to this day the priests of the temple
are considered special adepts in the manufacture of fans; hence the name Mieido is adopted by many fan
shops all over the islands. (Basil Chamberlain, <i>Things Japanese</i>.)</p></div>

the one published by A. Poggi in 1780, but not the one published by Poggi in 1782. Only four, so far as
he knows, were completed as fans, including the 1780 Poggi. The coppers on which the engravings were
made were of large size, so as to admit of the after addition of the form of the fan, and its ornamentation.
Some of the plates were afterwards cut down, lettered, and issued as separate prints.’ (Letter of Mr. Lionel
